              Release notes for the Microsoft(R) FORTRAN
             Professional Development System, Version 5.1

This document contains release notes for version 5.1 of the Microsoft
FORTRAN Professional Development System for MS-DOS(R) and the Microsoft
Operating System/2 (MS(R) OS/2).  The information in this document is
more up-to-date than that in the manuals and the Microsoft Advisor
(online help).

Microsoft improves its languages documentation at the time of reprinting,
so some of the information in this file may already be in your manuals.

=============================< The SETUP Program >=============================


Disk Space for Additional Libraries
-----------------------------------

Each library for a different combination of memory model and floating-
point arithmetic requires a minimum of 220K of disk space. If you intend
to create more than one library when running SETUP, be sure to take into
account the additional disk space required.


DECOMP.EXE
----------

The files on the FORTRAN 5.1 disks are compressed. SETUP uses a utility
called DECOMP.EXE to decompress the files before copying them to your hard
disk. Normally you should use SETUP to copy files, and they will be
decompressed automatically.

Occasionally, however, you may want to copy a file from the SETUP disks
directly to your hard disk without using the SETUP program. In that case,
you will have to use the DECOMP.EXE utility to decompress the file. The
syntax for DECOMP.EXE is:

     DECOMP filename.ab$ filename.abc

where filename.abc is the decompressed filename.

All compressed files end with $. If the filename extension is three
characters long, the final character will be replaced with a $. If the
extension is two characters, the two characters will be retained and a
$ will be placed in the third position. If the extension has one
character, then that character will be retained and followed by a $. If
there is no extension, then the filename will be given a suffix of a
single $.

For example:

     f1.ex$      ->  f1.exe
     source.do$  -> source.doc
     flib.fd$    -> flib.fd
     mulmix.c$   -> mulmix.c
     makefile.$  -> makefile



================< FORTRAN Programming with Microsoft Windows >================


Requirement for Windows Dynamic-Link Libraries
----------------------------------------------

All FORTRAN 5.1 dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) must explicitly export the
symbol WEP. To do this, the statement

     EXPORTS
         WEP

should be added to the DLL's module definition file. The WEP routine is
included in the FORTRAN 5.1 startup code. If a DLL already has a user-
defined WEP routine (for example, in a mixed-language DLL with existing C
code), the WEP routine should be renamed _WEP. The FORTRAN 5.1 startup
code will call _WEP, if present, during DLL termination. For additional
information concerning the WEP function, see the Windows 3.0 SDK
documentation.


Close All Files Before Exiting a Windows DLL
--------------------------------------------

When a Windows DLL written in FORTRAN terminates, any information
left in a file output buffer will be lost. This is a result of how DLLs
are terminated in Windows. To insure that all data is written to a 
file, explicitly CLOSE any open files in a DLL before the DLL is terminated.
One way of doing this is by adding a function to the DLL code that closes all
files, and calling this function just before the application terminates.


MessageBox Support
-------------------

FORTRAN supports two modes of MessageBox for QuickWin applications,
TASKMODAL and SYSTEMMODAL.  TASKMODAL requires that you respond to the
message box before the application will perform any further calculations;
however, all other applications currently running will not be affected.
SYSTEMMODAL requires you to respond before any application may run.


Maximizing Windows
------------------

To maximize the frame window of a QuickWin application, place the 
following statement in the WIN.INI file:

     [<appname>]
     QWINMaximized=1

where <appname> is the base name of your executable file. For example, if
the executable file is called PROGRAM.EXE, the value for <appname> would
be PROGRAM.


Windows DLLs and Subprograms with String Arguments
--------------------------------------------------

Don't pass char*(*) arguments to a subprogram residing in a Windows DLL.
This is because the runtime in the calling DLL or EXE cannot communicate
the length of the string with the runtime in the called DLL.



==============< Additions to the Microsoft FORTRAN Reference >=================

/Gt option
----------

The /Gt, or data threshold, compiler option can remedy a number of link-
time and run-time errors in FORTRAN 5.1.  The /Gt option sets a threshold
value that determines where data items are stored in memory. Data items
that are greater in size than the threshold value, and that would normally
be stored in the default data segment, or DGROUP, are moved to a far
segment of data.  This frees up more room in DGROUP for variables less
than the threshold value and for other uses, such as the program STACK
and NEAR HEAP.

Using the /Gt switch can often help eliminate the LINK errors:

     L1070: 'segment name':Segment exceeds 64K

where segment can be _BSS or _DATA

     L2041: Stack Plus Data exceeds 64K

and the run-time error:

     F6700: Heap Space Limit Exceeded

In each of these cases, too much data is being stored in DGROUP, and using
the /Gt switch may free up the required space.  See Section 7.6 of the
FORTRAN 5.1 Reference for more information.


/Oc Option
----------

When you use the /Oc (default common subexpression optimization), the
compiler examines only short sections of code for common subexpressions.
You can disable default common subexpression optimization with the /Od
option.


Special Device Names
--------------------

The list of special device names in the FORTRAN Reference Manual is
incomplete.  The complete list of special device names is:

     Device Name              Comments
     ===========              ========
     CON                      stdout, stdin
     USER                     stdout, stdin
     COM1                     COM1 port
     AUX                      COM1 alias
     LINE                     COM1 alias
     LPT1                     stdprn
     PRN                      stdprn
     LPT2
     LPT3
     LPT4
     ERR                      stderr
     NUL                      null device

Note that COM2, COM3, and COM4 are not special device names in FORTRAN 
5.1.

To access these devices, use an OPEN statement of the form:

      OPEN (10, FILE='lpt1')

For connections to LPT2 or COM2, you are also required to specify
STATUS='old'.  These two devices are not treated as standard devices
like LPT1 and COM1.  Output to these devices is of the same form as to a
file, i.e. the output is buffered and carriage control characters in 
column 1 are ignored.


/ND Option
----------

When using the /ND option in a module, you must also set the loadds
attribute on all subprograms called from outside the module.


Restrictions on String Assignment
---------------------------------

The right and left sides of a string assignment may not reference the
same memory location.  For example, the following may fail because the
generated code overlays the input as it produces the output:

     character *10 string/'0123456789'
     string = '#' // string
     write (*,*) 'string = ' string
     end


IBM VS Extensions in Microsoft FORTRAN
-----------------------------------------

Microsoft FORTRAN supports only the following IBM VS FORTRAN
extensions:

- 31-character names
- Allowing integer arrays to contain FORMAT specifications
- DO statements without specified labels
- DO WHILE statement
- END DO statement
- Equivalence of character and non character items
- Mixing of character and non-character items in COMMON
- NAMELIST
- Specification of common block items in DATA outside block data
    subprograms
- Initialization on the declaration line
- IMPLICIT NONE
- INCLUDE
- Length specification within declarations
- Noninteger array subscripts
- Z edit descriptor
- ! comments
- $ and _ in identifiers


$NOTRUNCATE Metacommand
-----------------------

$NOTRUNCATE is now the default. As a result, it is possible to create
variable names, common block names, and function or subroutine names that
are longer than the 26-character space allotted in a .LST file. If these
identifiers do not differ in the first 26 characters, the .LST file shows
them with the same name.


New NINT Functions
------------------

Three NINT intrinsic functions have been added: NINT1, NINT2, and NINT4.
These return integer values of one, two, and four bytes respectively.


The /4I2 Switch and the INT and NINT Functions
----------------------------------------------

The length of the value returned by the INT and NINT intrinsic functions
is determined by the integer storage switch: two bytes if /4I2 is used,
four bytes if /4I4 (the default) is used.

If you want these functions to return a value with a length different
from the length set by the integer storage switch, use INT1, INT2, or
INT4 instead of INT, and use NINT1, NINT2, or NINT4 instead of NINT.


80387 Coprocessor Instructions
------------------------------

The run-time libraries recognize the presence of an 80387 coprocessor. If
you are not using the alternate math package, the library uses the 80387
SIN and COS instructions, rather than deriving sines and cosines from the
FPTAN instruction.


Array Conformity in Functions and Subroutines
---------------------------------------------

A formal array argument in a subroutine or function does not have to have
the same number of dimensions or total size as the actual array argument
passed to it. This permits the procedure to contain a formal array that
is as large as you think you will ever need; the calling program can then
pass any array of the same size or smaller.

Note, however, that if the formal and actual dimensions do not match in
quantity and size, the formal array elements do not point to the same
memory locations as the actual array elements with the same subscripts.
In this case, your program has to calculate the correct subscripts.


"Out of Memory" Error Message
-----------------------------

This compiler error does not have an error number. It occurs when the FL
program does not have sufficient memory, as in the following cases:

1. You used wildcard characters to specify the files to be compiled (for
example, FL *.FOR) and there were too many files. The exact number of
files that can be handled depends on the amount of system memory.

2. The computer did not have enough free memory. This may occur when
other processes are running under Microsoft Windows or OS/2.


Additional Compiler Error Messages
----------------------------------

F2399: <name> : COMMON (or EQUIVALENCE) : automatic variable illegal.

A variable previously declared as AUTOMATIC cannot appear in a COMMON
block or an EQUIVALENCE statement.


F4187: Debugging information exceeds 64K - extra ignored.

There was more debugging information than could fit in the allotted 64K
space. The additional information (which is usually symbols) was
discarded.


Revised Compiler Error Message
------------------------------

The <attribute> in error message F2384 can be "common block" or
"equivalenced," in addition to ALLOCATABLE, EXTERN, FAR, or HUGE.


Linker Path Specification
-------------------------

The /link option does not allow you to specify the linker's path. FL
assumes the linker is in the same directory as the compiler.


FL Switch Default Values
------------------------

If no switches appear in the FL command line, the source code is compiled
with the following defaults:

1. The Large memory model is used
2. The 8086/8088 instruction set is used
3. 8087/287/387 in-line instructions are used for floating-point
   calculations
4. Variable, subroutine, or function names are not truncated
5. All integer and single-precision floating-point numbers are four bytes
6. All Microsoft extensions to FORTRAN are enabled
7. FORTRAN 66-style DO statements are disabled
8. Full optimization is performed
9. Debugging (extended run-time error handling) is disabled

Any metacommands in a source code file override these defaults.


Compiling Extremely Large Programs
----------------------------------

This release contains the file F1L.EXE, which is an alternate form of the
Compiler Pass 1 disk if you need it.

This compiler pass is used to compile programs that receive error message
"F1901: program too large for memory." The F1L.EXE pass is invoked by
 adding the /B1 option to the FL command line, as follows:

     FL  /B1  F1L.EXE  <sourcefile>.FOR

where <path> is the path (including drive and directory) where F1L.EXE
resides, and <sourcefile> is the name of the FORTRAN source file you are
compiling. Alternatively, you can rename F1L.EXE to F1.EXE to make the
high-capacity version the default.


Compiler Errors and Warnings Generated by $DEBUG and /4Yb
---------------------------------------------------------

In addition to the expanded run-time error handling and testing
that $DEBUG and /4Yb enable, there are a number of compiler errors and
warnings that appear if $DEBUG or /4Yb are used. They are:

Error F2367: INTEGER : range error
Error F2533: lower substring bound exceeds upper bound
Error F2534: upper substring bound exceeds string length
Error F2535: lower substring bound not positive
Error F2536: subscript out of range
Warning F4501: subscript out of range (array argument)



======< Additions to the Microsoft FORTRAN Environment and Tools >======


Displaying FORTRAN Arrays in CodeView
-------------------------------------

CodeView allows you to expand arrays and examine the individual elements
of an array.  This feature, however, only works on one-dimensional arrays.
Arrays of two dimensions or more cannot be expanded in CodeView.

Another limitation of CodeView is that it cannot keep track of elements
of HUGE arrays beyond the first 64K, or first segment, of the array.  An
attempt to display an array element beyond the first segment will fail to
give the proper value.


TXTONLY.OBJ
-----------

TXTONLY.OBJ is useful for programs that may use _clearscreen, _outtext,
_settextcolor, _settextwindow, and so on, but do not use graphics. If you
have a program that never has to work in or switch into graphics modes and
never changes the palette, linking TXTONLY.OBJ into your DOS .EXE file (in
the .OBJ field) will save about 12K of .EXE size.



================================< Miscellaneous >=============================

APPEND.EXE
----------

Do not use the APPEND.EXE utility (shipped with DOS 4.01 and later
versions) with FORTRAN applications.  FORTRAN 5.1 does not set the
APPEND path and the results are unpredictable.
