===========================< Source List >=================================

The \SOURCE directory contains the subdirectories PATCH, STARTUP, and
SAMPLES, and the files as described below. (NOTE: The files copied depend
on the options selected during SETUP.)

\SOURCE\STARTUP

  This directory contains OS non-specific startup files.  They are
  used in conjunction with the OS specific files found in
  \SOURCE\STARTUP\DOS, \OS2, and \WIN.

  The file STARTUP.DOC describes how to build new startup code for
  your FORTRAN run-time libraries. MASM is required to assemble
  the startup code.

  The file FILEHAND.DOC describes how to change the default limit on
  open files for a FORTRAN program.

\SOURCE\STARTUP\DOS

  This directory contains the files required for building new
  startup code for a DOS mode FORTRAN run-time library.

\SOURCE\STARTUP\OS2

  This directory contains the files required for building new
  startup code for a OS\2 mode FORTRAN run-time library.

\SOURCE\STARTUP\WIN

  This directory contains two .OBJ files that will allow a QuickWin
  application or a FORTRAN Windows DLL to open 64 files (as opposed to
  the default limit of 20 files).  See the FILEHAND.DOC file for more
  information.

\SOURCE\PATCH

  This directory contains information and files required to patch
  IBM PC-DOS 3.20.  There is a bug in IBM PC-DOS 3.20 which may cause
  improper operation of a program if a floating-point exception is
  generated.  The file PATCH320.DOC describes the procedure for
  patching IBM PC-DOS 3.20.

\SOURCE\SAMPLES

  This directory contains some general demonstration programs. The
  comments at the beginning of each program give further information,
  including any required compiler options.

    Files	  Description
    -----	  -----------

    DWHET.FOR	  Single- and double-precision versions of the Whetstone
    SWHET.FOR	  benchmark program measure floating-point calculation
		  speed.

    SIEVE.FOR	  The Sieve of Eratosthenes benchmark program measures
		  integer processing speed.

    EXEC.FI       The include file EXEC.FI contains interface statements
    DEMOEXEC.FOR  for the SYSTEM and SPAWNLP functions that allow a
                  program to execute DOS commands or other programs.
                  The program DEMOEXEC.FOR illustrates use of the include
                  file.

    SORTDEMO.FOR  This program visually illustrates six different sorting
		  algorithms. The source code demonstrates how to make
                  OS/2 calls and how to use the OS/2 include files.

    ANNUITY1.FOR  This program calculates a simple annuity table.  It is
                  used as an example program for the PWB tutorial and
                  contains intentional errors.

    MTRX.FOR      This program calculates the product of two matrices.  It
                  is used as an example of compiling a QuickWin application.

    MTRX_W.FOR    This program calculates the product of two matrices.  It
                  is similar to MTRX.FOR, but makes use of QuickWin
                  enhancements.

    MTRX_WD.FOR   These files create a version of MTRX_W that uses a
    MTRX_WD.DEF   Windows dynamic-link library (DLL).
    MATLIB.FOR
    MATLIB.DEF

    MULMIX.C      These files demonstrate how to create mixed-language
    MULMIX.H      Windows applications with C and FORTRAN.  There are
    MULMIX.RC     two versions of the MULMIX program. One version is
    MULMIX.DEF    a statically linked mixed-language application, and
    MULMIX.MAK    is built with MULMIX.MAK.   The other contains a
    MULF.FOR      mixed-language DLL and is built with MULMIX_D.MAK.
    MULC.C
    MULLIB.DEF
    MULMIX_D.DEF
    MULMIX_D.MAK

    RGMAIN.FOR    These files are a modular version of the REALG.FOR
    RGGRAPH.FOR   graphics example program.  They are used in the PWB
    RGGRID.FOR    tutorial to demonstrate how to manage a multimodule
    RGINIT.FOR    program.
    RG.MAK

    FMHELLO.FOR   This program demonstrates multithread OS/2 programming.

    FMTDLL.DEF    These files are used to demonstrate the creation of
    FMTDLL.FOR    multithread dynamic-link libraries under OS/2.  Build
    FMTMAIN.DEF   the DLL using MKFDLL.CMD.
    FMTMAIN.FOR
    MKFDLL.CMD

    FDLLOBJS.CMD  This batch file creates a dynamic-link library and a
    FDLLOBJS.DEF  corresponding imports library containing the FORTRAN
    DIFFHLP.DEF   run-time.  A pre-built version of FRTLIB.DLL is
                  included on the FORTRAN 5.1 distribution disks, and
                  is copied by the SETUP program.

    EMOEM.ASM     This file contains OEM customization routines for PC
                  clones that are not IBM compatible and that contain an
                  8087/80287/80387 coprocessor.

  This directory also contains the source code for the graphics programs
  from chapters 11, 12, and 13 of the Microsoft FORTRAN Advanced Topics
  manual. Note that these examples require the graphics include files 
  FGRAPH.FI and FGRAPH.FD. These files are copied to an INCLUDE directory 
  by the SETUP program. In real mode (DOS), the programs must be linked with
  the graphics library GRAPHICS.LIB. In protected mode (OS/2), graphics is
  not supported, but you can compile text-only programs by linking
  with the text library GRTEXTP.LIB. The appropriate libraries are
  copied to your disk by the SETUP program. For example, use the
  following command line for DOS:

    FL COLTEXT.FOR GRAPHICS.LIB

  Or use the following command line for OS/2:

    FL COLTEXT.FOR GRTEXTP.LIB
