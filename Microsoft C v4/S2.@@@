
A few IBM-compatible computers require the /D CodeView
option. The following are known to require this option:

     Tandy 1000            AT&T 6300 Plus 

Computers that work without /D include the following:

     Compaq                Eagle           
     HP Vectra             TI Business Professional
     AT&T 6300             Zenith (except model 100)
     Tandy 1200 or 3000    NCR PC

If your computer is not mentioned, try the session first
without /D. If you have trouble, try again with /D. If you
still have trouble, your computer isn't compatible. 

If you use the /D option, the CONTROL-C and CONTROL-BREAK
keys cannot be used to break out of the sample session.

Do you want to try the /D option? (Y/N) 
