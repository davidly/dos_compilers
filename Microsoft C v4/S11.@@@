
The rest of the session may be more helpful if you have a
printed listing of the source file, COUNT.C, and the file
to be analyzed, COUNT.TXT. If you have a printer that can
be accessed through the PRN device, you can now print these
files. Make sure your printer is properly attached to the
computer, that the power is on, and that the paper is adjusted.
