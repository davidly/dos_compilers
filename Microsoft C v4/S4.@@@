Welcome to the CodeView (TM) debugger.

Now the world-class Microsoft (R) C Compiler comes with a
world-class debugger. During this session, you'll see it
in action. You can learn how to use it and try it on your
own. By that time, we think you'll be ready to buy it.

The CodeView demonstration disk is freely copyable. You may
give the disk to friends, upload it to electronic bulletin
boards, or distribute it through computer clubs. Read the
CODEVIEW.DOC file for more information about distribution
and use of the demonstration disk.

The debugger on this disk (CVR.EXE) is a restricted version
that can only be used with the three sample programs. The
unrestricted version (CV.EXE) comes with Version 4.0 of the
Microsoft C Compiler.
