If you have a mouse, you can probably use it with the
CodeView debugger. However, the debugger is not guaranteed
to work correctly if your computer is not completely IBM
compatible or if your mouse is not a Microsoft Mouse. A
few non-IBM machines will not run the debugger at all with
a mouse.

Do you want to try using the mouse? (Y/N) 
