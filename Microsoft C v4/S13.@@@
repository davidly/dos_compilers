The program `PI' calculates the value of pi to whatever
precision you specify on the command line. Unlike other
sample programs on the demonstration disk, `PI.EXE' was
compiled from two source modules: `PI.C' and `MATH.C'.

The session opens the debugger with `PI' as the program to
be debugged. The number 60 is passed as a parameter so that
`PI' will calculate pi to 60 decimal places.

To quit, enter `Q' or select Quit from the File menu. For
on-line help, press F1 or select Help from the View menu.
Other than that, you're on your own. Good luck!

The debugger will now be started. Loading and initial
processing may take a moment . . .
