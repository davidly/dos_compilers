
If your computer is not IBM compatible, you will not be able
to run the sample session. You can still use the CodeView (TM)
debugger in sequential mode, as described in the CODEVIEW.DOC
file, which summarizes the CodeView commands and options. 

If you have a printer that can be accessed through the PRN
device, you can print CODEVIEW.DOC now. Make sure your printer
is properly attached to the computer, that the power is on,
and that the paper is adjusted.
