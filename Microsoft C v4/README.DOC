The directory \startup and its subdirectories contain the files
necessary for building the startup portion of the C runtime library.
The \startup directory contains the startup source files, the memory
model independent include files, the batch file and the make file used
to build the startup object files.  The subdirectories of \startup
contain the memory model dependent include file (version.inc) for the 
startup and are the repositories for the object files that get created 
by the startup batch file.  

The startup object files can be built by invoking startup.bat.  This
batch file assumes that the \startup directory and its subdirectories
S, M, C, and L exist and that make.exe, the C compiler and the assembler
are in the execution path.  MASM 4.0 or later is required to build the
startup sources with the makefile invoked by startup.bat.  The batch 
file also assumes that the startup sources are in the same directory as 
startup.bat.

The include files stdio.h and ctype.h are required for building the
startup source file wild.c but are not included on the \startup directory
because they exist on the directory containing the standard include files.
A make variable called CINC controls where the makefile looks for these
include files.  CINC is currently set to look for these include files in
the \startup directory by the line "CINC=.." in the makefile.  The value
of CINC can be changed appropriately if the includes are placed elsewhere.

The message "<cEnd - possible invalid use of nogen>" is generated 
when some of the assembly language source files are assembled.  This
message is expected and is totally benign.

The startup batch file requires arguments as described in the header of 
startup.bat.  Invoking startup.bat with no arguments will also give usage 
information.
