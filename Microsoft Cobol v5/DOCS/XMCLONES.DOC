                       USING XM WITH IBM COMPATIBLES
                       =============================


   This document should be regarded as a supplement to the chapter XM in
   your COBOL System Reference. It lists the IBM and IBM-compatible personal
   computers and BIOS families that XM has been tested with successfully
   It contains a list of steps you should follow before running on a clone
   (except when you are running exclusively from a Windows DOS Box).
   A quick reference table is also included to identify whether
   your machine, or one similar, has been found to work successfully
   with XM.

   INTRODUCTION
   ============
   XM is hardware and BIOS dependent, so it must be set up to recognize the
   BIOS of a clone machine before you will be able to use it. On
   initialization, XM first tries to recognize particular machine types for
   which it has been adapted; failing that it looks for particular BIOS
   identifications. If XM recognizes the BIOS but does not recognize the
   specific machine type, it assumes that the machine is similar to some
   other machine that uses that manufacturer's BIOS.

   If XM applies any default switch settings upon recognizing the machine or
   BIOS, these are noted here. Where information is available, this document
   includes a note of the BIOS date and any other relevant comments.

   Please note, when running in a Windows DOS Box, XM gets memory from 
   the DPMI host and consequently does not use XMS memory. For this
   reason, BIOS/clone-specific issues are not relevent when running XM in a
   Windows DOS Box.

       Note: This machine can be set to run at 8 or 10 MHz, but on early
             versions the reinitialization code in the ROM BIOS forces the
             speed down to 8 MHz. Since this is a 286 machine, XM invokes
             this code on every transition from protected to real mode, the
             effect of which is that XM always switches the machine 8 MHz
             mode. Running OS/2 on this machine has the same effect. Late
             versions overcome this problem.

       Notes:

       o  If you use the +J switch, avoid the Shft/Ctrl/Sysreq facility; it
           will lock the machine.  This is due to an anomaly in the Tandon
           BIOS where Int 15 (AX=8500) is issued before, rather than after,
           sending EOI.

       o  The /D switch is needed for some applications. Max mode transition
          frequency is about 660 per second; thus round-trip mode
          transitions should be separated by at least 3 milliseconds.

       Notes:

       o  Shft/Ctrl/Sysreq does not work.

       o  NMI problem on scroll: the COBOL Run-Time System, when about to
          scroll the checker output screen, may write to an I/O port that
          causes a non-maskable interrupt in protected mode.  It does this
          if it believes that the screen needs protection against snow. If
          you are using a screen (for example, EGA) which does not need this
          protection, you can avoid the NMI by forcing the RTS to omit snow
          protection using the run-time switch +S2, as follows:

              SET COBSW=+S2

   XM PREPARATION CHECKLIST
   ========================
   This section lists the steps you should take before attempting to run
   XM on a clone machine.   Full details on performing these steps are
   contained in the XM documentation in the COBOL System Reference. A
   summary is provided here for quick reference.

   1.  Determine the amount of extended memory

       XM requires at least 1.5 Mb of extended memory in order to run. To
       determine the amount of extended memory on your machine, enter
       following command line:

           XM +X

       Then at the prompt, enter:

           M,0

       (Note: This is the letter M followed by a comma and the number 0)
       The following information is displayed on the screen:

           zzzzzz free size yyyyyyy

       'yyyyyyy' is the amount of installed extended memory in hexadecimal.

   2.  Determine your machine BIOS type

       To  established which type of machine XM thinks it is running on type
       "XM +P2" followed by return your screen will look like this:

           C:\>XM +P2
           Machine nnnn

							  Micro Focus Ltd
	   URN AHUPA/ZZO/00000
           XM - Program not found

       where nnnn is the machine BIOS type, with the last two digits
       identifying the machine as follows:

           ff             plain PC
           fe             PC XT

       XM has sufficient information about the IBM industry standard BIOS to
       work without any problems. However, clone machines' BIOS is normally
       modified from the standard and hence may need to use switches to
       correctly identify its BIOS to XM.

       Having established the machine ID, you can then determine which, if
       any, of the /P switches may be necessary.

       There are no hard and fast rules for determining which /P switch will
       work for a particular clone machine. It is simply a matter of trial
       and error until you find a switch that works for your machine.

       Past experience has shown that the machine ID generally corresponds
       to the /P switch required. So, if your machine ID is 01 through 07,
       you should try the corresponding /P1 through /P7 switches.

       Similarly, machine IDs ff through f8 are generally 286 machines,
       which generally respond to the switches /P2, /P4 or /P9.

       For 386 machines, switches /P1 or /P6 have been found to work.

       You may also wish to refer to the following list, which indicates
       switches that have been used successfully with particular types of
       machine BIOS. Don't limit yourself to these suggestions, though; if
       you are not successful with these, continue to experiment until you
       find one that does work.

           /P1 is generally for Compaq 386 machines

           /P2 is for Award BIOS machines

           /P3 is for older AMI BIOS versions, pre 1990

           /P4 is for Phoenix BIOS machines

           /P5 is for a Tandon BIOS, or the AMI BIOS dated August 30,1990

           /P6 is a generic switch for 386 machines

           /P7 is a generic switch for Compaq 286 or similar machines

       N.B. These switches are NOT always necessary.

       XM switches can be set either on the command line or in the XM
       environment variable as documented in the XM chapter in the COBOL
       System Reference. Some examples are provided here.

       Example:

       You can set XM switches and invoke COBOL from the command
       line as follows:

	   "XM /P1 +JR COBOL"

       or, you can specify these settings in the environment variable:

           "SET XM=/P1+JR"

       and then invoke COBOL from the command line, which picks up and uses the
       XM variable from the environment. The settings in the environment
       variable can be added to or overridden by typing extra parameters for
       XM on the command line.

   3.  Check your keyboard configuration

       If you can successfully use XM and invoke the Editor, the next step
       is to check that the keyboard works correctly. Very often the "
       character may appear as @. In order to correct this, the +J switch
       should be used. This switch forces the keyboard configuration that
       was present when the machine was booted up. Note that this will work
       only if your AUTOEXEC.BAT file contains a KEYB command.

   4.  Check your operating system configuration

       It is assumed that no devices or TSR's are loaded at this time. If
       this is not the case, then strip your config.sys and autoexec.bat
       down to basics. You should then reboot the machine set to use DOS and
       COBOL only.

       Example:

           Config.sys
           ----------
           shell=c:\dos\command.com /e:1024 /p
	   buffers=30
	   files=100


           Autoexec.bat
           ------------
	   SET COBDIR=C:\COBOL\BIN
	   SET COBHNF=C:\COBOL\HELP
	   SET INCLUDE=C:\COBOL\SOURCE
	   SET HELPFILES=C:\COBOL\HELP
	   SET LIB=C:\COBOL\LIB
	   PATH C:\;C:\DOS;C:\COBOL\BIN
	   SET INIT=C:\COBOL\INIT


       When you are satisfied that this basic configuration allows you to
       use XM, then add back network and any other devices and TSRs.

       Note that if you are using XM when attached to a network, the +R
       switch MUST be used. This will prevent the workstation from hanging.


   XM COMPATIBILITY TABLE
   ======================
   The following table lists the Make, Model, BIOS type and default switches
   applied for XM. Try the switches suggested for your machine, or one
   similar, to see if they solve any problems you may have encountered
   trying to run XM. If you still have trouble after following the
   suggestions in this document, please see your Environment and Tools book
   on how to contact Support.

   Notes:
   This machine can be set to run at 8 or 10Mhz, but on early versions the
   reinitialization code in the ROM Bios forces the speed down to 8Mhz;
   since this is a 286 machine, XM invokes this code on every transition
   from protected to real mode, and the effect is that XM always switches
   the machine into 8Mhz mode. Running OS/2 on this machine has the same
   effect. Later versions overcome this problem.

   XM will work in conjunction with the workstation control program in dft
   mode on all IBM machines except PS/2 mod 80, 70, and the 3270 PC.
   The following configuration is required:
    o  One 2m xma board (configured as expanded memory to be used by the
       workstation control program)
    o  One extended memory board (IBM part no. fc3006) used by XM
    o  Switch settings +BKR and /M384  NOTE: the workstation control program
       uses part of extended memory; hence the /M switch.
   IBM has a patch to HLLAPI that prevents XM from working correctly when
   the workstation control program is installed.

   Due to an anomaly in the Tandon Bios where Int 15 (AX=8500) is issued

   /D option needed for some applications. Max mode transition frequency is

   Notes:
   Shft/Ctrl/Sysreq does not work.
   NMI problem on scroll: the COBOL Run-time System, when about to scroll
   the compiler	output screen, may write to an I/O port that causes a
   non-maskable interrupt in protected mode. It does this if it believes
   that the screen needs protection against snow. If you are using a screen
   (for example, VGA) which does not need this protection, you can avoid the
   NMI by forcing the Run-Time System to omit snow protection using the
   run-time switch +S2, as follows:

       SET COBSW=+S2

   Notes:
   2/90 if XM is run, the keyboard becomes reconfigured by actually swapping
   most of the keys on the keyboard. To overcome this problem, you must
   first remove the ANSI.SYS driver and then use the +J switch.

   Notes:
   The /M256 is needed because this machine has a built in memory area that
   can be used as either Expanded or Extended memory, depending on how the
   machine is set up. However, XM doesn't like that area as it is not, by
   hardware default, Extended memory. Because of this, the "Not Enough
   Extended Memory" error message is given. This memory is apparently
   addressed at the 1 megabyte address. The /M256 tells XM to skip over this
   configurable area.
