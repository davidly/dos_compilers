   Introduction
   ------------
   This document is for use when maintaining applications created using
   earlier releases of this product.

   It describes the differences that may cause problems, and includes
   documentation of features no longer documented in this system, but
   maintained for compatibility.

   Note that the use of the compiler with default settings will cause the
   use of new words to become reserved.  A list of these words is given
   below.


   Changes in Microsoft COBOL 5.0
   ------------------------------

   Compiling
   ---------
    o  ON EXCEPTION is no longer allowed with CHAIN since it has never been
       supported at run-time. It now gives a severity E error message which
       does not prevent compilation from continuing. Using HIDEMESSAGE(1047)
       will prevent the error from being visible."

    o  Use of the MF directive when compiling will cause some data-names
       to be illegal as the reserved word list has been extended. If you
       have this problem, either change the data-name, use the
       REMOVE(reservedword) directive or recompile with MF(7).

       New reserved words included when using MF(8) are:


       IGNORE
       KANJI
       LOWER
       NATIONAL
       NATIONAL-EDITED
       UPPER
       WAIT


    o  The RW directive has been withdrawn. It has had no effect since
       COBOL V4.0.

    o  The default for the PANVALET directive is now NOPANVALET. ++INCLUDE
       is no longer flagged when PANVALET is specified, and -INC is no
       longer flagged when LIBRARIAN is specified. If you specify LIBRARIAN
       and PANVALET together, a warning is displayed that the compiled
       program may not be mainframe-compatible.

    o  ON EXCEPTION and ON OVERFLOW clauses are no longer accepted for the
       CHAIN verb.  The WARNING message that was given for them has been
       changed to an ERROR message. (In previous releases the syntax
       was accepted but there was no run-time support.)

    o  The handling of Directives files has changed so that they can now be
       truly nested. Previously, if you specified the DIRECTIVES directive
       in a directives file, the Compiler switched to the new directives
       file and did not return to the original one. Now it does return.
       Consequently, further directives in the original Directives file are
       processed, whereas in previous releases they were ignored.


   Changes in Microsoft COBOL 4.5
   ------------------------------
   Compiling

    o  Use of the MF directive when compiling will cause some data names
       to be illegal as the reserved word list has been extended.  Change
       the dataname, use the REMOVE(reservedword) directive or recompile
       with MF(6).

       New reserved words included when using MF(7) are:

       ALPHABET        ALPHABETIC-LOWER        ALPHABETIC-UPPER
       ALPHANUMERIC    ALPHANUMERIC-EDITED     ANY
       BINARY          CLASS                   COMMON
       COMP-1          COMP-2                  COMP-4
       COMPUTATIONAL-1 COMPUTATIONAL-2         COMPUTATIONAL-4
       CONTENT         CONTINUE                CONVERTING
       CYCLE           DAY-OF-WEEK             DBCS
       DISPLAY-1       EJECT                   END-ADD
       END-CALL        END-COMPUTE             END-DELETE
       END-DISPLAY     END-DIVIDE              END-EVALUATE
       END-IF          END-MULTIPLY            END-PERFORM
       END-READ        END-RECEIVE             END-RETURN
       END-REWRITE     END-SEARCH              END-START
       END-STRING      END-SUBTRACT            END-UNSTRING
       END-WRITE       EOL                     EOS
       EQUALS          EVALUATE                EXCEEDS
       FALSE           FUNCTION                GLOBAL
       ID              INITIALIZE              LOWLIGHT
       NUMERIC-EDITED  ORDER                   OTHER
       PACKED-DECIMAL  PADDING                 PARAGRAPH
       PURGE           REFERENCE               REPLACE
       SKIP1           SKIP2                   SKIP3
       SORT-RETURN     STANDARD-2              TEST
       TIME-OUT        TIMEOUT                 TITLE
       TRUE            UNEQUAL                 WAIT
       WHEN-COMPILED

      Note that most of these words are already reserved under the ANS85 or
      VSC2 directives, so will only become new if you are compiling with MF
      but without ANS85 or VSC2.

   o  RM compatibility

      When compiling for RM compatibility, if the same behavior is required
      as with Microsoft COBOL 4.0 then you should compile with the
      DETECTLOCK directive.

   o  ASSIGN TO PRINTER

      Files defined with ASSIGN TO PRINTER are treated as LINE ADVANCING in
      COBOL 4.5. In 4.0, they were treated as LINE SEQUENTIAL.

   o  NEXT SENTENCE

      In COBOL 4.0, you could make NEXT SENTENCE jump to the appropriate
      end-scope delimiter by using the MF"5" directive (see below). In 4.5
      this directive does not have this effect.

   o  Nested Programs

      In V4.0, nested programs could have Configuration Sections. In V4.5
      they cannot.

   o  The "DISPLAY ... UPON CRT Attributes Behavior" switch S6 is no longer
      documented in the Operating Guide. Here is its description. With the
      Enhanced DISPLAY (see the Screen Handling chapter of the Language
      Reference Manual), if no attributes are specified on the DISPLAY then,
      by default, the attributes already existing in the given area will be
      used. If the switch +S6 is specified at run time the normal screen
      attributes will be used instead.

   o  In earlier versions of this COBOL system all system library routines
      were call-by-number. Many of the call-by-name routines in the present
      product replace old call-by-number routines. The list below indicates,
      for each call-by-name routine that has replaced a call-by-number
      routine, the number of the routine it has replaced. In some cases the
      call-by-name routine has additional features.

       Name                   Number
       ----                   ------
       CBL_READ_SCR_CHARS       B7 0
       CBL_READ_SCR_ATTRS       B7 2
       CBL_READ_SCR_CHATTRS     B8 0
       CBL_WRITE_SCR_CHARS      B7 1
       CBL_WRITE_SCR_ATTRS      B7 3
       CBL_WRITE_SCR_CHATTRS    B8 1
       CBL_WRITE_SCR_TTY        82
       CBL_WRITE_SCR_N_CHAR     B7 4
       CBL_WRITE_SCR_N_ATTR     B7 5
       CBL_SWAP_SCR_CHATTRS     B8 2
       CBL_GET_SCR_SIZE         E3
       CBL_SET_CSR_POS          E6
       CBL_CLEAR_SCR            E4
       CBL_GET_KBD_STATUS       D9
       PC_READ_DRIVE            91 5
       PC_SET_DRIVE             91 6
       CBL_READ_DIR             91 7
       CBL_CHANGE_DIR           91 8
       CBL_DELETE_FILE          91 18
       CBL_RENAME_FILE          91 17
       PC_TEST_PRINTER          B0 7
       CBL_SPLIT_FILENAME       8C
       CBL_JOIN_FILENAME        8D

   o  The behavior of COPY ... REPLACING has been changed depending on the
      setting of the ANS85 or VSC2(3) directives. Previously all non-COBOL
      characters were disallowed in operands to COPY ... REPLACING, and
      lowercase and colon were added to the character set. This behavior now
      only occurs if the ANS85 or VSC2(3) directive is used. Otherwise, the
      operands may contain non-COBOL characters.


   Changes in Microsoft COBOL 4.0
   ------------------------------
   General

    o  When installing on an OS/2 system, SETUP will add PATH and
       environment variable information to CONFIG.SYS and not to OS2INIT.CMD
       as in previous releases. This conforms with the standard for
       installing OS/2 v1.1 and later.

    o  The files, DBCS.EXE/.DLL and V-ISAM.DLL are no longer required, and
       are not included with this release.

    o  The shared run-time files, COBLIB.DLE and COBLIB.DLL are used by the
       components of this system, and must be loaded for the system to
       operate. COBLIB.DLE is required for DOS, COBLIB.DLL for OS/2.

    o  The callable file handler interface is no longer part of this
       product. If you wish to use the CALLFH feature, or to call the file
       handler directly, you will require a copy of the Micro Focus COBOL/2
       Toolset.

   Compiling

    o  The default directives, NOCOPYLBR, ANS85, NOOSVS and MF are now built
       into the compiler and are not included in the COBOL.DIR created by
       SETUP. ANS85 and OSVS can be changed by SETUP, so that NOANS85 and/or
       OSVS are included in the COBOL.DIR created by SETUP. SETUP also
       allows selection of SAA and the default linking libraries.

    o  VSC2 is now equivalent to VSC2(3). Previously VSC2 was equivalent to
       VSC2(2).  The directives VSC2 OLDVSC2 have been replaced by VSC2(1).

    o  The directive OLDFILEIO has been replaced by the directive IDXFORMAT
       which defines the type of indexed file required. IDXFORMAT"2" is
       equivalent to OLDFILEIO.

    o  The verb, GOBACK, and the special register, RETURN-CODE are now part
       of the standard Micro Focus(R) COBOL language and can be used without
       needing VSC2 or OSVS. They are enabled by an MF level of 5 or above
       (on by default) and can, therefore, be disabled by specifying MF(4).

    o  Comments following the PROGRAM-ID, which were allowed in previous
       versions, are now not allowed by default. They can, however, be
       enabled using the PROGID-COMMENT directive.

    o  For interfacing at the assembler level, note that the object segment
       class names created by the COBOL compiler have changed in this
       release.

    o  The default ALPHASTART value has been set to 1 to conform to the
       ANSI'85 standard. In previous versions, this was set to 0. If you
       have programs that use the ALPHABET clause of the SPECIAL-NAMES
       paragraph, you may need to specify the directive ALPHASTART"0" to
       maintain the required behavior.

    o  ACCEPT .. FROM DAY-OF-WEEK

       The statement

	   ACCEPT data-item FROM DAY-OF-WEEK

       incorrectly returned the value 0 for Sunday. It now returns a value
       of 7, as documented.

    o  COMP-5

       The default behavior of USAGE COMP-5 data items has been changed. In
       previous versions of the product, COMP-5 was treated in a similar
       fashion to signed COMP. It is now treated in a similar fashion to
       COMP-X, allowing it to be a true binary numeric item using machine
       specific byte ordering. This makes it a very efficient data type.

       If you use COMP-5 in existing programs, and depend on its sign
       handling, you should compile your programs with the COMP-5"1"
       directive.

    o  NEXT SENTENCE

       NEXT SENTENCE is handled differently in this version of the product.
       In previous versions NEXT SENTENCE would cause control to move to the
       end of the sentence (i.e. following the next period) or to the
       statement following the next end-scope delimiter. In this version, it
       will always go to the end of the sentence, as defined by the ANSI'85
       standard.

       If your program uses NEXT SENTENCE and relies on the change of
       control being to the appropriate end-scope delimiter, you can use the
       MF"5" directive (but see above for V4.5). Alternatively, change the
       NEXT SENTENCE phrases to CONTINUE, which will have the desired
       effect.

    o  SYMBOLIC CHARACTERS clause

       The default SYMBSTART value has been set to 1 to conform to the
       ANSI'85 standard. In previous versions, this was set to 0. If you
       have programs that use the SYMBOLIC CHARACTERS clause of the
       SPECIAL-NAMES paragraph, you may need to specify the directive
       SYMBSTART"0" to maintain the required behavior.

    o  RECORDING MODE

       The RECORDING MODE phrase has been amended so that, when it is
       explicitly included in an FD, it overrides the RECORD clause in all
       cases, with RECORDING MODE F always causing a fixed format file to be
       created, and RECORDING MODE V a variable format file.

       If you require the original behavior, whereby RECORDING MODE is
       overridden by the RECORD clause, then use the MF"5" directive.

       Note that the RECMODE directive will not override the RECORD clause.

    o  REPORT-WRITER reserved words

       The RW directive has been made obsolete by incorporating the REPORT-
       WRITER reserved words into the main dialects that support REPORT-
       WRITER. If you have a program that uses some REPORT-WRITER reserved
       words as data names, and used to be compiled with the NORW directive,
       then you need to replace the NORW directive by USE(NORW). This will
       cause the REPORT-WRITER reserved words to be removed from the
       reserved word list, making them available for use as data names.

    o  INSPECT

       The handling of the LEADING phrase in INSPECT has been amended to
       make it conform to a recent interpretation of the ANSI'85 standard.
       For example, if data-stream contains "//AAA BBB OOO CCC", the
       statement

	   INSPECT data-stream TALLYING count-field
	       FOR LEADING "A" "\" " "O" "C"

       returned the value 5 in count-field in previous versions, but now
       returns the value 2. This is because the remaining characters in the
       LEADING phrase are considered to be ineligible once a match has been
       found on one of the characters.

    o  COPY filenames

       Since this version now distinguishes between filenames with no
       extension, but with a trailing period, and those without a trailing
       period (treating the former as a specified extension of spaces),
       some COPY statements in existing programs may appear to stop
       working. If you want your copy files to have extension .CPY, but
       code them in your program with no extension, then you must be sure
       that the name does not have a trailing period. For example, change:

	   COPY "mycopy.".

       to

	   COPY "mycopy".

       Note that

	   COPY mycopy.

       is treated as if it has no trailing period, and hence as in previous
       versions.


   Running

    o  A large number of the run-time system subprogram calls, provided in
       earlier releases as call-by-number calls, have been replaced by named
       calls. In addition to making the calls easier to remember and use,
       the call-by-name calls can accept parameters defined in any part of
       the data division.

       The replaced call-by-number calls are still supported in this
       release, and documented below. However, we recommend that you
       replace them with the equivalent call-by-name calls as appropriate.

    o  Record sizes

       In previous releases, the maximum and minimum record sizes specified
       for a variable format file had to be the same in every program
       referencing the file. This restriction has been removed, allowing
       programs to specify record lengths different to those specified in
       the program used to create the file. However, if an attempt is made
       to write a record which is smaller than the smallest defined or
       larger than the largest defined a run-time error, 9/044, will be
       returned.

   Animating

    o  The method required to animate programs has changed in this release.
       When a program is compiled for animation, using the ANIM directive,
       intermediate code files are packaged into .OBJ files and .DLL on
       OS/2). These .EXE/.DLL files can be animated in the usual way. The
       pure intermediate code files (.INT) are no longer required for
       animation.

    o  Since the new animation method incorporates a link step, any non-
       COBOL .OBJ files can be linked in prior to animation. These will
       operate correctly when encountered, though always in zoom mode. This
       new technique makes IANIM and augmented INT obsolete, and these
       facilities are not supported in this release.

       The same method allows OS/2 API function calls to be resolved prior
       to animation, avoiding the need for the Install Function technology
       of earlier releases.

    o  This release has the +F switch set by default. This will cause
       illegal data in numeric fields to be trapped during animation, and
       when running intermediate code .OBJ files (run-time system error
       163). This may cause existing programs to fail where they previously
       worked. However, trapping such instances will help prevent the
       subsequently generated code from failing. All generated programs will
       work as at present, always assuming that numeric fields contain
       numeric data.

   Linking

    o  The linking library, OS2.LIB, should be used instead of DOSCALLS.LIB
       when linking applications for use on OS/2(tm). OS2.LIB is supplied as
       part of the utilities. (DOSCALLS.LIB can be used provided the
       application is not a Presentation Manager application.)

    o  The /NOP option is no longer required when linking for use on OS/2.

    o  The default environment for applications created using this release
       is the shared run-time environment.  This is particularly recommended
       for use on OS/2, where a single copy of COBLIB.DLL can be shared by
       any COBOL application (built to use COBLIB) running in any OS/2
       session.

       To use this environment, the application is linked in the usual way,
       using the libraries, COBLIB.LIB, and COBAPI.LIB or OS2.LIB depending
       on DOS or OS/2. The EXE files produced will be much smaller since
       little run-time system code is included directly. System programs,
       such as EXTFH and ADIS, can be linked in with the application, or
       linked as standalone sub-programs. Again, for OS/2, if linked as
       standalone .DLL files, they can be shared by any number of COBOL
       applications.

       Notes:
	-  These system programs MUST be linked with COBLIB for use with
	   COBLIB applications.

	-  Modules linked with COBLIB cannot be mixed with modules linked
	   with LCOBOL. Hence, applications must be either all LCOBOL or all
	   COBLIB. However, COBLIB applications and LCOBOL applications can
	   be run on the same environment as long as they don't try to call
	   each other.

    o  The linking library (.LIB) files supplied with the system have been
       split in a different way to enable reduced disk usage. They now
       consist of LCOBOL.LIB, COBLIB.LIB, and COBAPI.LIB. The new LCOBOL
       is equivalent to the old PCOBOL. The addition of COBAPI.LIB to
       LCOBOL.LIB gives the old LCOBOL. (Users may like to recombine these
       libraries using LIB if they wish to retain old working practices.)
       For OS/2 operation, LCOBOL.LIB is used in combination with OS2.LIB
       (which supersedes DOSCALLS.LIB).

       In the shared run-time system, the default, COBLIB.LIB, is equivalent
       to the old PRCOBOL.LIB. Again, either COBAPI.LIB or OS2.LIB is used
       in combination with COBLIB.LIB to complete the linking for DOS or
       OS/2 respectively. Applications linked with these libraries will be
       very much smaller, benefiting from the shared run-time system support
       in COBLIB.DLE and COBLIB.DLL. (Note that the application itself can
       be bound so that it will run on both DOS and OS/2 provided both
       shared run-time system files are present.)

    o  If you select a linking environment other than the built-in default,
       SETUP will create a default LINKLIB in your COBOL.DIR. The default,
       and equivalent of earlier releases, is LINKLIB(LCOBOL+COBAPI). If
       you normally use the system on OS/2, use LINKLIB(LCOBOL+OS2). With
       this release, the default is to use the COBLIB shared run-time system,
       requiring LINKLIB(COBLIB+COBAPI) on DOS, and LINKLIB(COBLIB+OS2) on
       OS/2.

       When the default has been set in this way, you can still link for use
       in other environments by specifying the relevant libraries on the
       LINK command line. However, you should use the /NOD directive when
       doing so, otherwise link-time errors may occur.

    o  The file handler for indexed files, IXSIO, has been replaced by the
       external file handler, EXTFH. This can be linked in exactly the same
       way as IXSIO in earlier releases, either linked in with the
       application or linked as a standalone system program.

       Programs referencing ANSI'85 EXTERNAL files and normal indexed files
       now only use EXTFH rather than two separate file handlers.

    o  If you compile your programs on OS/2 using batch files, you will need
       to alter the batch files to compile using the command COBOL instead
       of PCOBOL. Alternatively, you can copy COBOL.EXE to PCOBOL.EXE in the
       COBOL system directory.

    o  Programs previously compiled without the ANS85 directive, if
       recompiled under this default system, may not work correctly. The
       most likely cause is that the new system has ANS85 on by default.
       This causes all file status codes to be ANS85 not ANS74 statuses.
       The problem can be avoided by using the NOANS85 directive when
       compiling any program that is designed to work with ANS74 file
       statuses.

   Animating

    o  The compiler dictionary structure has been amended. This means that
       IDY files created by earlier releases will not be compatible with
       ANIMATOR in this system. Hence, you should recompile, with this
       release of the compiler, any program you wish to animate.

   Linking

    o  .OBJ files created by this release are not compatible with .OBJ files
       created by earlier releases. Hence, if you need to rebuild an
       application where one of the OBJs has been created using this
       release, you must recompile all the programs with this release of the
       compiler before linking.

   Running

    o  In previous versions of this software, an error is given when an
       indexed file is opened if the record lengths of the file do not
       exactly match those given in the FD. This has been changed so the
       error is only given if an attempt is made to WRITE a record larger
       than the maximum or smaller than the minimum.

    o  The Report Writer module has been changed so that it is compatible
       with IBM(R) OS/VS COBOL when the OSVS directive is used. This is the
       ANSI'68 COBOL standard. In previous versions, the default with OSVS
       was ANSI'74 COBOL standard report writer. You may have report writer
       programs using OSVS features, but requiring ANSI'74 report writer
       compatibility. This mix is no longer possible, and you will either
       need to remove the OSVS features (try VSC2), or accept ANSI'68 COBOL
       report writer standard.


   Documentation
   -------------
   Call-by-number subprogram calls.

   Many of the COBOL system library routines provided in earlier releases as
   call-by-number have been replaced by call-by-name routines.	We recommend
   that you replace all call-by-number routines by their equivalent call-by-
   name routines. See your Operating Guide chapter, COBOL System Library
   Routines, for details of which call-by-name routines replace these.

   To allow you to maintain existing applications, the documentation for the
   replaced call-by-number routines follows:


   PUT A CHARACTER TO THE SCREEN

       CALL X"82" USING character.

   where:

       character is a PIC X field containing the character to be put on the
       screen in the current cursor position.

   The cursor is then advanced one position to the right, or onto the next
   line if it is in the rightmost position, or off the screen if it is in
   the bottom right-hand corner.


   READ A CHARACTER FROM THE KEYBOARD

       CALL X"83" USING character.

   where:

       character is a PIC X field to contain the character returned.

   Notes:  1.  A call on this subprogram also causes the function key table
	       to be checked and the result byte updated.

	   2.  If the character returned from this subprogram is a carriage-
	       return character (hex 0D), then the character read from the
	       keyboard has been recognized by the function key table, and
	       the result byte of that table should be checked to determine
	       the actual character which has been pressed.

	   3.  If the character read is a 2-byte character (such as a
	       function key) and it was not matched in the function key
	       table, then both bytes are returned to this subprogram.	The
	       first call returns a null byte (hex 00) and the next call
	       returns the scan code (refer to the IBM Personal Computer
	       Technical Reference Manual for details of scan codes).

	   4.  Break can be used to interrupt a running program.  However,
	       if the program was in the middle of a call to this subprogram
	       at the time, nothing happens until the call on this
	       subprogram is satisfied by reading another character from the
	       keyboard.  Break is not returned by this routine.


   SCREEN INPUT AND OUTPUT

       CALL X"B7" USING function, parameter, buffer

   where:

       function is a PIC 99 COMP-X data item and contains a value:

	   0   to read characters from the screen
	   1   to write characters to the screen
	   2   to read attributes from the screen
	   3   to write attributes to the screen
	   4   to clear characters from the screen
	   5   to clear attributes from the screen


       parameter is a group item consisting of three data items:

	o  a PIC 9(4) COMP-X field  showing the length of the data to be
	   read or written.

	o  a PIC 9(4) COMP-X field giving the start position on the screen.
	   Top left is position 1, 81 is the start of the next line, etc.

	o  a PIC 9(4) COMP-X field showing the start position in the buffer.
	   The starting  buffer position is 1.

       buffer is the COBOL data area. It is a PIC X(n) field and may be as
       large or small as you require to write your data.

   An entire screen of text or attributes is 2000 bytes.  No check is made
   that any data to be read will fit into your buffer.	Therefore, if the
   length specified is greater than the length available in your buffer, any
   subsequent data will be corrupted.  Buffer is not used with a function of
   4 or 5, but this parameter must still be supplied.

   Note: When writing or clearing characters, the User attribute is imposed
	 on the character position, unless the User attribute flag is set
	 off, in which case the current Screen attribute for that character
	 position is used.


   SCREEN CELL INPUT AND OUTPUT

       CALL X"B8" using FUNCTION PARAMS CHARBUFF ATTRBUFF

   where parameters are:

       01 FUNCTION     PIC 9(2) COMP-X

		=   0 to read screen to character and attribute buffers
		=   1 to write screen from character and attribute buffers
		=   2 to swap screen with character and attribute buffers

       01 PARAMS
	   03	   P-LENGTH	   PIC 9(4) COMP-X.
	   03	   P-SOFFSET	   PIC 9(4) COMP-X.
	   03	   P-BOFFSET	   PIC 9(4) COMP-X.

		P-LENGTH   =	   number of screen cells to read/write/swap
		P-SOFFSET  =	   screen offset (1 = top left)
		P-BOFFSET  =	   buffer offset (1 = start of buffer)

       01 CHARBUFF
	   03	   CHARS PIC X OCCURS n TIMES

			   =	   an array of character bytes

       01 ATTRBUFF
	   03	   ATTRS PIC X OCCURS n TIMES

			   =	   an array of associated attribute bytes


   TEST CONSOLE STATUS

       CALL X"D9" USING parameter.

   where:

	parameter is a PIC 99 COMP-X field and shows the status of the
		  console:

	   zero        there is no character waiting to be read from the
		       keyboard

	   non-zero    there is a character waiting to be read from the
		       keyboard

   When a program is being animated in other than zoom mode, this function
   always returns a zero (i.e., it never detects a character), because
   ANIMATOR always looks for characters.  However, the function operates
   correctly when zoom mode is used.


   GET SCREEN SIZE

       CALL X"E3" USING no-lines, no-cols.

   where:

       no-lines is a PIC 99 COMP-X field and shows the number of lines on
       the screen.

       no-cols is a PIC 99 COMP-X field and shows the number of columns on
       the screen.


   CLEAR SCREEN

       CALL X"E4".

   This routine clears the entire user screen.


   MOVE THE CURSOR TO A DEFINED POSITION

       CALL X"E6" USING result, parameter.

   where:

       result is a PIC 99 COMP-X field.  It is not used.

       parameter is a group item consisting of two data items:

	o  a PIC 99 COMP-X field specifying the row number for the cursor to
	   be moved to; in the range 0 to 24.

	o  a PIC 99 COMP-X field giving the column number for the cursor to
	   be moved to; in the range 0 to 79.
