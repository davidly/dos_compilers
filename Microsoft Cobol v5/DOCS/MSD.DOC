The Microsoft Diagnostics (MSD) utility is designed to assist
Microsoft customers and Product Support Services (PSS) technicians in
identifying system configuration information such as the BIOS and
video card type and manufacturer, processor(s) installed, I/O port
status, operating system version, environment settings, hardware
devices attached, and additional software running concurrently with
MSD. This utility is used when Microsoft PSS needs information to
diagnose and solve problems with Microsoft products.

USING THE MICROSOFT DIAGNOSTICS UTILITY
=======================================

The MSD utility (MSD.EXE) runs in DOS and in a Windows DOS Box. To
start MSD, do the following:

1. At the DOS prompt, change to the root directory (where you
   installed MSD.EXE).

2. Type "msd" (without the quotation marks) and press the ENTER key.
   (For monochrome, black-and-white, and LCD screens, type "msd /b"
   and press ENTER.)

3. The program presents an introduction screen. To continue, press any
   key.

MSD then presents a Main Menu screen split into two sections. The
upper section presents a summary of information that the utility has
gathered from your system. For additional information on any category,
move the highlight bar (using the arrow keys) to any category and
press the ENTER key. A dialog box appears that presents detailed
information for that category. You can quickly choose any category by
pressing the ALT key and the highlighted letter corresponding to the
category you want. Return to the Main Menu screen by pressing the ESC
key.

USES FOR THE MICROSOFT DIAGNOSTICS UTILITY
==========================================

The Microsoft Diagnostics utility is designed to be used in one of
three ways:

1. Over the telephone, you can report the information MSD displays to
   the Microsoft PSS technician assisting you in solving the problem
   you are experiencing.

2. You can fax or mail Microsoft PSS a report generated by MSD. The
   Generate Reports feature will print the information to any TTY
   printer. Be sure to send the report to the attention of the
   technician assisting you.

   The mailing address is below. Microsoft's fax number is
   (206) 883-8101. Include the following attention line on the fax
   cover sheet:
   
      ATTN: PSS, <technician's name, building, group>

3. You can send us a report file generated by MSD. The Generate
   Reports feature will print a configuration report to a file. You
   can copy this file to a floppy disk and send it to the technician
   helping you or send the file electronically by modem.
