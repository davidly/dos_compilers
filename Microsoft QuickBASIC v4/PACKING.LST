  Important Notes
  ---------------
  This disk contains a number of demonstration and utility programs written
  in BASIC. These files	are for	informational and recreational purposes
  only,	and Microsoft makes no warranties, either expressed or implied,
  as to	their suitability for specific purposes	or their correctness,
  accuracy, or reliability. The	entire risk as to the results and
  performance of the software is assumed by you.

  All programs ending with the .BAS extension are QuickBASIC source files.
  Programs with	an asterisk (*)	next to	their names require a color-graphics
  adapter to run.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  FILE OR DIRECTORY	DESCRIPTION
  -----------------	-----------------------------------------------------
  BCOM40.LIB		The QuickBASIC alternate run-time-module library;
			used for creating executable files from	QuickBASIC
			and DOS	(files created with this library do not
			require	BRUN40.EXE to run).

  BQLB40.LIB		The library of supporting routines that	are used when
			creating Quick libraries.

  MOUSE.COM		The Mouse driver for use with QuickBASIC programs
			that call mouse	functions.

  QBHERC.COM		The driver file	for use	with computers equipped	with
			a Hercules(R) Graphics Card, Graphics Card Plus,
			Hercules InColor Card, or 100%-compatible clones of
			these graphics cards.  This file allows	you to write
			BASIC programs that use	screen mode 3 for graphics
			output.	(See the README.DOC file for more information.)

  FIXSHIFT.COM		A terminate-and-stay-resident program that fixes a bug
			in the ROM BIOS	of some	machines with keyboards	that
			have an	extra set of DIRECTION (i.e. arrow) keys, in
			addition to those on the numeric keypad. See README.DOC
			for more information, if you have such a keyboard.

  QB.LIB		The stand-alone	library	containing support routines
			for DOS	system calls.

  QB.QLB		The Quick library containing support routines for
			DOS system calls.

  QB.BI			An include file	for use	with BASIC programs that
			call any of the	following routines in the QB.QLB
			Quick library or in the	QB.LIB stand-alone library:
			ABSOLUTE, INTERRUPT, INTERRUPTX, INT86OLD, or
			INT86XOLD.  The	QB.BI file defines the types for
			arguments passed to these routines and also gives
			DECLARE	statements for these routines.

  QB.PIF		A file that provides information to aid	in running
			QuickBASIC under Microsoft Windows.

  ABSOLUTE.ASM		The assembly-language source for the ABSOLUTE
			routine	in QB.QLB and QB.LIB.  This routine
			allows you to call a machine-language procedure
			from a BASIC program.  (BASIC's CALL statement
			and the	new DECLARE statement provide a	simpler	way
			to call	other-language procedures from BASIC.)
			This source file is provided for reference only, and
			is not required	to use the ABSOLUTE routine.

  INTRPT.ASM		The assembly-language source for the INTERRUPT and
			INTERRUPTX routines in the QB.QLB and QB.LIB
			libraries.  These routines allow you to	perform
			DOS system calls from a	BASIC program.	This source
			file is	provided for reference only, and is not
			required to use	the INTERRUPT or INTERRUPTX routines.

  NOCOM.OBJ		(NO COMmunication). An object file to link with	BASIC
			programs that do not require communications support.
			Linking	with NOCOM.OBJ reduces the size	of executable
			files that do not perform any communications activity.

  NOEM.OBJ		(NO EMulation).	An object file to link with BASIC
			programs that will always be run on machines with an
			8087 or	80287 math coprocessor	chip.  Linking with
			NOEM.OBJ turns off software emulation of the math
			chip's function, and reduces the size of the
			executable file.

  DEMO1.BAS		The BASICA version of the sound-effects	demonstration
			program	referred to in Chapter 2 of "Learning and
			Using Microsoft	QuickBASIC."

  DEMO2.BAS		The QuickBASIC 2.0 version of the sound-effects
			demonstration program referred to in Chapter 2 of
		        "Learning and Using Microsoft QuickBASIC."

  DEMO3.BAS		The QuickBASIC 4.0 version of the sound-effects
			demonstration program referred to in Chapter 2 of
		        "Learning and Using Microsoft QuickBASIC."

  REMLINE.BAS		A utility program that converts	BASICA programs
			saved in ASCII format to QuickBASIC-style programs
			by removing unreferenced line numbers.

  SORTDEMO.BAS		A program that uses multicolored bars and sound	to
			illustrate various sorting algorithms.

  TORUS.BAS*		A graphics demonstration program that draws a
			multicolored doughnut-shaped figure on the screen,
			then makes it appear to	rotate by shifting colors
			in the palette.

  \SOURCE		A directory containing BASIC programs printed in the
			QuickBASIC manuals, as well as other demonstration
			programs.  See list of contents	for this directory
			below.

  CAL.BAS		A program that prints a	calendar for any month in
			any year from 1899 to 2099.

  CHECK.BAS		A checkbook-balancing program that sorts and prints a

			user, then prints the final balance in the checking
			account.

  COLORS.BAS*		A program showing all combinations of the 16 background
			colors and 3 foreground	colors (distinct from the
			background) in the 2 color palettes available in screen
			mode 1.

  CRLF.BAS		A program that opens an	ASCII file, expands any	lines
			ending with just a carriage return or a	line feed to
			a carriage-return--line-feed combination, then writes
			the adjusted lines to a	new file.

  CUBE.BAS*		A program that illustrates simple animation of a
			cube by	using multiple screen pages in screen mode 7.

  ENTAB.BAS		A program that compresses an ASCII file	by replacing
			runs of	spaces with tab	characters.

  FILERR.BAS		A program that searches	for a string of	characters in

			file-access errors such	as the user's entering an
			invalid	file name or leaving a drive door open.

  FLPT.BAS		A program that lets you	examine	the internal format
			used by	BASIC to store single-precision	numbers.

			directory containing the file.

  INDEX.BAS		A file I/O program that	builds and searches an index
			of record numbers from a random-access data file.

  MANDEL.BAS*		A program that generates a fractal (a colorful graphic
			representation of the properties of certain real
			numbers) on the	screen.

  PALETTE.BAS*		A program that demonstrates how	to give	the illusion
			of movement by rotating	the colors displayed by
			the color attributes from 1 to 15.

			DRAW statement.

  QLBDUMP.BAS		A program that allows you to get a listing of the
			PUBLIC code and	data symbols in	a QuickBASIC Quick
			library.

  SEARCH.BAS		A program that searches	any disk file for a pattern
			and reports every byte position	in the file where
			the pattern begins.

  SINEWAVE.BAS*		A program that plots the graph of the sine-wave
			function for angle values from 0 to PI (3.14159265)
			radians.

  STRTONUM.BAS		A program that converts	to a numeric value any number
			input as a string, after first filtering invalid
			numeric	characters (such as commas) out	of the
			string.

  TERMINAL.BAS		A program that turns your computer into	a "dumb"
			terminal when used with	a modem.

  TOKEN.BAS		A program that breaks an input string into a series
			of tokens (a string of characters delimited by
			blank spaces, tabs, or punctuation marks such as
			commas or semicolons).

  WHEREIS.BAS		A program that recursively searches through all
			directories on a disk for the file name	input by the
			user.  When WHEREIS finds the file, it prints the
			complete directory path	to the file.
