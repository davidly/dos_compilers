F87 - Hardware Floating-Point for DX-Forth

F87 requires an 80387 or compatible floating-point processor.  Applications
compiled with F87 will check whether a suitable FPU is present and abort
with an error if none is found.

F87 models currently supported:

F87S.SCR   single precision (32 bit) reals on data stack
F87D.SCR   double precision (64 bit) reals on data stack
F87DS.SCR  double precision (64 bit) reals on separate stack
F87X.SCR   extended precision (80 bit) reals on data stack

Compile the model of your choice e.g.  FORTH.EXE F87D 1 LOAD BYE

While F87 includes several IEEE 754 features such as NaN/Inf, signed-zero,
rounding modes etc. there is no attempt to be IEEE 754 compliant.

F87 Glossary:

FINIT ( -- )          Performs 80x87 FPU instruction 'finit' resetting the
                      FPU hardware and rounding mode to "round to nearest/
                      even". If a compatible FPU is not present an error
                      message "requires 80387+ FPU" is issued and the
                      application aborts. By default FINIT is executed by
                      COLD.

CW@ ( -- cw )         Get FPU control word
CW! ( cw -- )         Set FPU control word

SET-NEAR  ( -- )      Set FPU rounding to "nearest or even" (default)
SET-FLOOR ( -- )      Set FPU rounding to "round down"
SET-CEIL  ( -- )      Set FPU rounding to "round up"
SET-TRUNC ( -- )      Set FPU rounding to "round towards zero" i.e. truncate

FROUND ( r1 -- r2 )   Round to integral value using current rounding mode
FNEAR  ( r1 -- r2 )   Round to integral value nearest or even
FLOOR  ( r1 -- r2 )   Round to integral value nearest negative infinity
FCEIL  ( r1 -- r2 )   Round to integral value nearest positive infinity
FTRUNC ( r1 -- r2 )   Round to integral value nearest zero

SIGNED-ZERO ( -- addr )  A VARIABLE which controls floating-point
                      negative-zero display. Default is OFF.

F0= ( r -- flag )     Return true if r is zero, or false otherwise. Does not
                      differentiate between positive and negative zero.

F= ( r1 r2 -- flag )  Return true if r1 and r2 are equal, or false otherwise.
                      Does not differentiate between positive and negative
                      zero.

FLOG ( r1 -- r2 )     r2 is the base-ten logarithm of r1. An ambiguous
                      condition exists if r1 is less than or equal to zero.

FALOG ( r1 -- r2 )    Raise ten to the power r1, giving r2.

FSIGNBIT ( r -- sign )  Return sign of r as indicated by the IEEE sign bit.

FSIGN ( r -- sign )   As for FSIGNBIT except the sign of -0.0E is determined
                      by variable SIGNED-ZERO.

FCLASS ( r -- +n )    Return class of floating-point number r. +n is a
                      positive non-zero value indicating NaN, infinite,
                      normal, subnormal, zero or the 80x87 conditions
                      unsupported and empty.

FP-NORMAL ( -- +n )   CONSTANT representing f/p finite class
FP-SUBNORMAL ( -- +n ) CONSTANT representing f/p subnormal class
FP-ZERO ( -- +n )     CONSTANT representing f/p zero class
FP-INFINITE ( -- +n ) CONSTANT representing f/p infinity class
FP-NAN ( -- +n )      CONSTANT representing f/p NaN class

+INF ( -- r )         FCONSTANT returning f/p number '+Inf'
-INF ( -- r )         FCONSTANT returning f/p number '-Inf'
+NAN ( -- r )         FCONSTANT returning f/p number '+NaN'
-NAN ( -- r )         FCONSTANT returning f/p number '-NaN'

>FLOAT ( c-addr u -- r true | false | other 1 )
  Extend >FLOAT semantics to return 1 and the corresponding IEEE datum
  if any of the case-insensitive strings "NaN" "Inf" "Infinity", with or
  without sign, are present.

REPRESENT ( r c-addr n1 -- n2 flag1 flag2 )
  In addition to the semantics for REPRESENT (see DX-Forth glossary) when
  flag2=false return a string "+NAN" "-NAN" "+INF" "-INF" or "BADFLT" in
  the buffer at c-addr padded with trailing blanks (BL). n2 is reserved
  and flag1=sign. Rounding direction is per current rounding mode.
