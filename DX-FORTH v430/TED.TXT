
                Text File Editor for DX-FORTH
                -----------------------------

TED is a resident text file editor.


INSTALLATION:

DX-FORTH for CP/M must be configured for your terminal before
using the text file editor.  See DX-FORTH.TXT for further
details.

Users who prefer working with text files can replace the
resident screen file editor in DX-Forth with TED.  To do this
enter the following from the DOS command prompt:

     A:FORTH-F - SYSTEM INCLUDE TED AKA TED EDIT SAVE DX BYE


INVOKING:

The text editor is invoked by typing TED.  If the editor is
not resident it is automatically loaded from disk file TED.F

If you mainly use text files you may want to add EDIT as a
synonym for TED as previously described.

     TED ( "filename[.F]" -- )

Load and edit the text file "filename".  If no filename is
given use the file specified by LASTFILE and LOADLINE.

Note: Specifying a filename with TED is only available once
TED has been loaded and the loader stub overwritten.

A "load/size error" is reported if the file cannot be found,
is write-protected or too large to fit in memory.

Edits are confined to memory and only written to disk on
exit with ^U (S)ave or when writing to another filename with
^Z (W)rite.

Lines can be up to 132 characters but only the leftmost are
displayed and directly editable.  Tabs are converted to
single spaces.
