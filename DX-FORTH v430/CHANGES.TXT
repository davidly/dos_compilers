                          IMPORTANT CHANGES

This document discusses changes to DX-Forth for DOS that may adversely
affect previously written programs.  It is recommended users update their
programs to the latest DX-Forth version.  See WHATSNEW.TXT for a summary
of other changes and additions.


v4.30

   Removed immediate EXIT and renamed (EXIT) to EXIT.

v4.07

   -TRAILING ZCOUNT now use the SSEG segment.  See SSEG in the glossary
   for details.

v4.05

   EDIT can no longer be used to load the editor from disk.  You must use
   SED or TED for that.  Once the editor is loaded and saved as part of
   the system, EDIT can be added as a synonym.

v4.03

   ALLOT has been changed (for the better).  Unlike Forth-94 ALLOT only
   unsigned values may be used.  Applications which used negative values
   with ALLOT should be changed to use -ALLOT instead.  Programs which
   require Forth-94 behaviour can be accommodated with the following
   redefinition:

     : ALLOT ( n -- )  NEGATE -ALLOT ;

   Note however that memory checking is not performed.

v4.02

   Functions '.' and '?' adopt the eForth behaviour i.e. when BASE is
   decimal display signed; otherwise display unsigned.  Only these
   functions and those which use them are affected.  Applications
   requiring Forth-94 behaviour may redefine:

     : . ( n -- )  S>D D. ;
