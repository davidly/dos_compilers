   (*
   - end-of line character

   This (non-ASCII) constant defines the internal name
   of the end-of-line character. Using this constant has
   the advantage, that only one character is used to
   specify line ends (as opposed to cr/lf).

   The standard I/O modules interpret this character
   and transform it into the (sequence of) end-of-line
   code(s) required by the device they support. See
   definition modules of 'Terminal' and 'FileSystem'.
