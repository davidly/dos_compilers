DEFINITION MODULE Terminal;
(*

   Terminal Input/Output

This module uses the read and write procedures from
module TermBase, which allows to redirect the i/o.

Derived from the Lilith Modula-2 system developed by the
group of Prof. N. Wirth at ETH Zurich, Switzerland.

EXPORT QUALIFIED
   Read, KeyPressed, ReadAgain, ReadString,
   Write, WriteString, WriteLn;


PROCEDURE Read (VAR ch: CHAR);
(*
- Read a character from the terminal.

out:    ch      character that was read.

The character is not echoed.
The character ASCII.cr is transformed into ASCII.EOL.
*)


PROCEDURE KeyPressed (): BOOLEAN;
(*
- Test if a character is available to Read from terminal.
*)


PROCEDURE ReadAgain;
(*
- Undo the last read: Make the last character be re-read.
*)


PROCEDURE ReadString(VAR string: ARRAY OF CHAR);
(*
- Read (with echo) a line from the terminal.

out:    string  receives the text of the line

Characters are accepted (and echoed) from the keyboard
until <cr> is entered.  The <cr> is not returned or
echoed. <del> and <bs> can be used for editing.
Tabs may be entered, but are expanded into blanks
immediately. No other control characters may be entered.
*)


PROCEDURE Write (ch: CHAR);
(*
- Write a character to the terminal.

in:     ch      character to be written.

If terminal output has not been redirected, the following
interpretations are made:

    ASCII.EOL  (36C) = go to beginning of next line
    ASCII.ff   (14C) = clear screen and set cursor home
    ASCII.del (177C) = erase the last character on the left
    ASCII.bs   (10C) = move 1 character to the left
    ASCII.cr   (15C) = go to beginning of current line
    ASCII.lf   (12C) = move 1 line down, same column
*)


PROCEDURE WriteString (string: ARRAY OF CHAR);
(*
- Write a string to the terminal.

in:     string          string to be written.

The string is terminated by its physical length or by a
null character (0C).
*)


PROCEDURE WriteLn;
(*
- Write a new-line to the terminal.
  [Equivalent to Write(ASCII.EOL)]
*)


END Terminal.
