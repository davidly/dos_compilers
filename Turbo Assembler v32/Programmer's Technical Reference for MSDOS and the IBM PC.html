 This book is a technical reference. It is NOT a tutorial. Hopefully, this
book is what you'll reach for when you want find out what Peter Norton or the
"official" references glossed over.

 This manual is intended to replace the various (expensive) references needed
to program for the DOS environment, that stack of magazines threatening to take
over your work area, and those odd tables and charts you can never find when
you need them.

 The various Microsoft and IBM publications and references don't always have
the same information. This has caused some consternation about the
"undocumented" features to be found in DOS. In general, if a call doesn't
appear in the IBM DOS Technical Reference it is considered "undocumented"
although it may be documented by other OEMs or by later Microsoft tech
bulletins.

 The information here is valid for DOS 2.x through 5.x. Where there are
differences between the two versions there are notes in the text. No great
effort was expended on DOS 1.x.

 When I started writing this book, it was originally for my own personal use.
Then I began expanding it with the idea of getting it published, since at that
time there was *nothing* in print like it. (late 1987) If I had managed to
send it off to the publishers early enough, I would have had it made. As it
was I lost six months having a nice steel rod put in my leg after being run
over by a drug addict in an uninsured car, and half a dozen similar books were
published by then, and nobody was interested in mine. Six months is a long
time in the PC world.

 That's why I'm uploading this file as "user-supported." It gives me a chance
to recoup a few bucks for the time I've been working on this thing, and it
gives some advantages that a printed book can't - first, you can load it on
your hard disk and use Vern Buerg's LIST or SideKick to scan through text. You
can grab a piece of something and paste it into a document, etc. If you help
support the Reference you will always have the latest version available; you
can't "upgrade" books.

 A project this size takes a LOT of time and effort. I've tried to verify as
much of the information I've received as I could, but there's just too much for
absolute certainty.  The TechRef has been in the hands of some heavy-duty code
jockeys for a couple of years now with very few bug reports, though.

 If you find any typos, incorrect information, or want to see something else,
let me know. If you have any more detailed information on something, PLEASE let
me know!

 As is common these days, I have to make a "Notice of Disclaimer". I take no
responsibility for anything, and if anything you do with this book ruins you
for life or makes your dog bite you, or anything else, that's just tough.

 I hope you find much use for this reference. It was a trip to write, too.

        They will forward your order to the USA and you will receive the
        absolute latest version of DOSREF by airmail straight from the
        author.  This means there will be about a three week delay before
        your order arrives.  We appreciate your business!

        Spearwood is our dealer only; for support write or E-mail the
        author, Dave Williams, at the above address.

   Why support DOSREF instead of relying on one of those public domain
 "interrupt lists"?  Sheer size, for one.  Even in LHarc format DOSREF
 bulks out to over a megabyte, making it too large for most sysops to
 consider keeping online.  Registered users also get support via:

        The Courts of Chaos BBS (TechRef support board)
        RIME/RelayNet
        BIX
        CompuServe
        airmail

  You get the very latest edition of this manual on disk, with no worries
 about corrupted or tampered text.  DOSREF is a quality product, in use
 by the US Navy, CalTech, Borland, NEC, Wang, General Motors, Citicorp,
 Rockwell, Honeywell, Digital Research, Central Point Software, 20th Century
 Fox, Associated Press, hospitals, universities, and government agencies
 around the world.

  The Registered User reference consists of over a megabyte of the compressed
 technical reference, appendices, and sample source code. That's about three
 megabytes of raw data when uncompressed, or several times larger than the
 shareware version.

  The Registered User version contains information on device drivers, mouse
 programming, Virtual Control Program Interface, Microsoft Windows 2.x, hard
 drives, hardware information, virus and Trojan programs, EMS 3.2, LIM 4.0,
 EEMS 3.2, CD-ROM, network programming, DOS 5.0, and more.

  Registered users will be advised by mail of updates.

  Several people who have downloaded copies over three years old have written
 to see if I was still supporting the Reference.  The answer is yes.  Not only
 that, but my book contract calls for keeping the information current.  If
 you're concerned, just drop a postcard.

 *****************************************************************************

 Foreign langauge versions are available!

  Klaus Overhage of Stuttgart, West Germany has licensed DOSref for
 redistribution and is now able to provide versions in German.  Klaus' version
 is a separate product from this one and must be purchased separately. Klaus
 is providing full support for German users.  If you'd like a copy in German,
 please contact:

                             Klaus Overhage
                             Rosenstrasse 15 A
                             7000 Stuttgart 50
                             Germany

  I hope to have other languages available soon.  If you are interested in
purchase or translation, please contact me for details.

 *****************************************************************************

  For payment in British pounds, Canadian dollars or EuroCheques, see
 INVOICE.TRF and PAYMENT.  I fully support foreign users!  If you're having
 trouble arranging payment, write (or leave EMail) and I'll try to work
 something out.

  Do you live outside the US?  If so, you're probably familiar with the
 hassles of keeping up with the latest information - the three to five month
 lead time for US publication, plus time for local book dealers to catalog
 new releases, plus problems in trying to order... plus the delays while your
 book comes in on special order, goes through Customs, the inevitable price
 hikes through all the middlemen, taxes...  not only is DOSREF priced
 well below the price of good printed computer books in the US, it's probably
 far cheaper than you could expect to pay for US books locally.  Plus your
 order will show up in your very own mailbox by air mail.

                               How to use DOSREF

 This reference changes so often that any attempt to format it for pagination 
would be a tremendous waste of time. Simply printing the thing out and letting 
the pagebreaks fall where they may is how most people do it. The neatest 
solution is Vern Buerg's LIST.COM or SideKick's file view function. If your
editor has multiple-window support, you can open a small window into the 
Reference and cut and paste into your source.

 An efficient method of using the Reference is to concatenate all the chapters 
together with the COPY command, ie COPY CONTENTS + CHAPTER.001 + CHAPTER.002 +
..... + CHAPTER.017   REF.  (REF being the new file name for the concatenated 
files.) With LIST.COM, the backslash (\) or F9 key will search for strings. 
You can then dump pieces of text to a disk file or your printer.

 If you work better with a printout than scanning with a file viewer, try 
setting your printer to 132 columns. This allows a nice margin for writing 
notes and eliminates the problem some printers have when printing 80 
character wide text. Some of the text and charts in the reference are a full 
80 columns wide; unfortunately some printers wrap automatically at 79 columns.
Some printers don't handle a combination of compressed print and graphics 
characters very well either. You may have to use the PRTRFIX.COM program 
provided on Disk 1 to squelch the graphics for printing.

 I strongly recommend using a viewer instead of printing. If you *must* print 
the Reference out, do it in stages so your printer does not overheat. Some
inexpensive printers will self-destruct after a couple of hours.

SOME HISTORY����������������������������������������������������������� 1**1

 Development of MSDOS/PCDOS began in October 1980, when IBM began searching
the market for an operating system for the yet-to-be-introduced IBM PC.
Microsoft had no 8086 real operating system to sell, but quickly made a deal
to license Seattle Computer Products' 86-DOS operating system, which had been
written by Tim Paterson earlier in 1980 for use on that company's line of 8086,
S100 bus micros. 86-DOS (also called QDOS, for Quick and Dirty Operating System)
had been written as more or less a 16-bit version of CP/M, since Digital
Research was showing no hurry in introducing CP/M-86.

 This code was quickly polished up and presented to IBM for evaluation. IBM
had originally intended to use Digital Research's CP/M operating system, which
was the industry standard at the time.

 Folklore reports various stories about the rift between DRI and IBM. The most
popular story claims Gary Kildall or DRI snubbed the IBM executives by flying
his airplane when the meeting was scheduled. Another story claims Kildall
didn't want to release the source for CP/M to IBM, which would be odd, since
they released it to other companies. One noted industry pundit claims
Kildall's wife killed the deal by insisting on various contract changes. I
suspect the deal was killed by the good ol'boy network. It's hard to imagine
a couple of junior IBM executives giving up when ordered to a task as simple
as licensing an operating system from a vendor. Wouldn't look good on their
performance reports. It would be interesting to hear IBM's story...

 IBM found itself left with Microsoft's offering of "Microsoft Disk
Operating System 1.0". An agreement was reached between the two, and IBM agreed
to accept 86-DOS as the main operating system for thir new PC. Microsoft
purchased all rights to 86-DOS in July 1981, and "IBM Personal Computer DOS
1.0" was ready for the introduction of the IBM PC in October 1981. IBM
subjected the operating system to an extensive quality-assurance program,
reportedly found well over 300 bugs, and decided to rewrite the programs. This
is why PC-DOS is copyrighted by both IBM and Microsoft.

 Some early OEM versions of DOS had different names, such as Compaq-DOS, Z-DOS,
Software Bus 86, etc.  By version 2 Microsoft managed to persuade everyone but
IBM to refer to the product as "MS-DOS."

 It is sometimes amusing to reflect on the fact that the IBM PC was not
originally intended to run MSDOS. The target operating system at the end of the
development was for a (not yet in existence) 8086 version of CP/M. On the other
hand, when DOS was originally written the IBM PC did not yet exist! Although
PC-DOS was bundled with the computer, Digital Research's CP/M-86 would probably
have been the main operating system for the PC except for two things - Digital
Research wanted $495 for CP/M-86 (considering PC-DOS was essentially free) and
many software developers found it easier to port existing CP/M software to DOS
than to the new version of CP/M.

 The upgrade from DOS 3.3 to 4.0 was done in-house by IBM.  DOS 4.0 was a
completely IBM product, later licensed back to Microsoft. In early 1990 IBM
announced that it was ceasing development of DOS and all further work would
be done solely by Microsoft.


 Microsoft Press' "MSDOS Encyclopedia" shows a reproduction of a late
DOS 1.25 OEM brochure.  Microsoft was touting future enhancements to
1.25 including Xenix-compatible pipes, process forks, and multitasking,
as well as "graphics and cursor positioning, kanji support, multi-user
and hard disk support, and networking."  Microsoft certainly thought
big, but, alas, the forks, multitasking, and multiuser support never
came about, at least in US versions of DOS.  Oddly, the flyer claims
that

 "MS-DOS has no practical limit on disk size. MS-DOS uses 4-byte XENIX
OS compatible pointers for file and disk capacity up to 4 gigabytes."

 Umm... yeah.  One sort of gets the idea nobody at Microsoft had a hard
disk larger than 32 megabytes...

 For the record they actually delivered:

Xenix-compatible pipes             DOS 2.0  ("|" operator)
process forks, and multitasking   eDOS 4.0  (not delivered in the US)
multi-user                         never delivered
graphics and cursor positioning    DOS 2.0  (ANSI.SYS, more than likely)
kanji support                      DOS 2.01, 2.25 (double-byte char set)
hard disk support                  DOS 2.0  (subdirectories)
networking                         DOS 3.1  (file locking, MS Networks)

 Early Microsoft ads pumped DOS' Xenix-like features and promised Xenix
functionality in future releases.

 We'll probably never know what the real story was behind eDOS/DOS 4/
DOS 5/286DOS/OS2.  Microsoft had announced their intent to build a
multitasking, multiuser version of MSDOS as early as 1982.  They shipped
betas of "DOS 4.0" in '86 and early '87, before 3.3 was even announced.
Microsoft UK announced they had licensed 4.0 to Apricot Computer, and
the French Postal Service was supposed to be running it.  I've never
been able to find out if Apricot ever shipped any 4.0 to end users.

 Despite Gordon Letwin's acid comments about problems with the 80286
processor, I doubt the '286 was the barrier between users and a
multitasking MSDOS.  I also doubt there was any shortage of programming
talent at Microsoft - Digital Research's Concurrent DOS and Software
Link's PC-MOS were developed without undue trouble.


 MSDOS and PC-DOS have been run on more than just the IBM-PC and clones. Some
of the following have been done:

WHAT IS DOS?����������������������������������������������������������� 1**2

 DOS exists as a high-level interface between an application program and the
computer. DOS stands for "Disk Operating System", which reflects the fact that
its main original purpose was to provide an interface between the computer and
its disk drives.

 DOS now lets your programs do simple memory management, I/O from the system
console, and assorted system tasks (time and date, etc) as well as managing
disk operations. Versions 3.1 and up also incorporate basic networking
functions.

 With the introduction of installable device drivers and TSR (terminate but
stay resident) programs in DOS 2.0, the basic DOS functions may be expanded to
cover virtually any scale of operations required.


OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS������������������������������������������������ 1**3

 There are a number of compatible replacements for Microsoft's MSDOS. Some are:

Alloy 386 Multiware                  (multitasking control prog, licensed DOS)
Consortium Technologies MultiDOS     (multitasking, multiuser)
Digital Research Concurrent DOS      (multitasking)
Digital Research Concurrent DOS 386  (for 80386 computers)
Digital Research Concurrent DOS XM   (multitasking, multiuser)
Digital Research DR-DOS 3.31 and 5.0 (PC-DOS clones)
Digital Research Multiuser DOS       (multitasking, multiuser)
PC-MOS/386                           (multitasking, multiuser)
Wendin-DOS                           (multitasking, multiuser)
VM/386                               (multitasking)

 Various other operating systems are available for the IBM PC. These include:

Digital Research CP/M-86
Digital Research Concurrent CP/M-86 (multitasking)
Minix (multitasking UNIX workalike)
Pick  (database-operating system)
QNX   (multitasking, multiuser)
UNIX  (various systems from IBM itself, Microsoft-SCO, Bell, and various UNIX
       clones, single and multi user) (AIX, Xenix, AT&amp;T System V, etc.)

 "Shell" programs exist which use DOS only for disk management while they more
or less comprise a new operating system. These include:

     DesQview                        Windows                     OmniView
     GEM                             TopView                     TaskView
     GeoWorks

 Systems using the NEC V-series CPUs can execute Intel 8080/8085 8-bit
instructions as well as the 16-bit 8088-up instructions.  They can run standard
Digital Research 8-bit CP/M and MP/M directly, as well as other operating
systems developed for that processor.



SPECIFIC VERSIONS OF MS/PC-DOS����������������������������������������� 1**4

 DOS 1.x is essentially 86-DOS.  DOS 2.x kept the multiple file layout (the two
hidden files and COMMAND.COM) but for all practical purposes is an entirely
different operating system with backwards compatibility with 1.x.  I seriously
doubt there has been much code from 1.x retained in 2.x. DOS 3.x is merely an
enhancement of 2.x; there seems little justification for jumping a whole
version number.  The disk handling routines were considerably extended in 3.1,
allowing disk access in a "virtual" fashion, independent of whether the drive
was a local or network device.  DOS 4.0, originating as it did from outside
Microsoft, can justify a version jump.  Unfortunately, 4.0 seemed to have very
little reason to justify its existence - virtually all of its core features
could be found in one version or another of DOS 3.x.  According to Microsoft's
Gordon Letwin, DOS 5.0 was a complete rewrite with the kernel done in hand
optimized assembly language.

 DOS version nomenclature: major.minor.minor.  The digit to the left of the
decimal point indicates a major DOS version change.  1.0 was the first version.
2.0 added support for subdirectories, 3.0 added support for networking, 4.0
added some minimal support for Lotus-Intel-Microsoft EMS.

 The first minor version indicates customization for a major application.  For
example, 2.1 for the PCjr, 3.3 for the PS/2s.  The second minor version does not
seem to have any particular meaning.

 IBM's PC-DOS was long considered to be the "standard" version of DOS.  Now
that MS 5.0 is a commercial product most developers will probably write to it.

 Microsoft's policy has been to sell DOS only to OEMs.  Despite this, they
sold small quantities of DOS 3.2, 3.3, and 4.0 without insurmountable
difficulties.  DOS 5.0 was conceived from the beginning as an over-the-counter
retail product.

 Incidentally, IBM refers to its DOS as "The IBM Personal Computer DOS." The
term "PCDOS" is a trademark of IBM's rival DEC.

 Some versions of MS-DOS varied from PC-DOS in the available external commands.
Some OEMs only licensed the basic operating system code (the xxxDOS and xxxBIO
programs, and COMMAND.COM) from Microsoft, and either wrote the rest themselves
or contracted them from outside software houses like Phoenix.  Most of the
external programs for DOS 3.x and 4.x are written in "C" while the 1.x and 2.x
utilities were written in assembly language.  Other OEMs required customized
versions of DOS for their specific hardware configurations, such as Sanyo 55x
and early Tandy computers, which were unable to exchange their DOS with the IBM
version.

 PC-DOS 3.0 was extremely buggy on release.  It did not handle the DOS
environment correctly and there were numerous documented problems with the
batch file parser.  The network support code was also nonfunctional in that DOS
version.  It is recommended that users upgrade to at least version 3.1.

 DEC MSDOS versions 2.11 for the Rainbow had the ANSI.SYS device driver built
into the main code.  The Rainbow also used a unique quad density, single-sided
floppy drive and its DOS had special support for it.

 IBM had a version 1.85 of PC-DOS in April 1983, after the introduction of DOS
2.0.  It was evidently for internal use only, supported multiple drive file
searches (a primitive form of PATH), builtin MODE sommands for screen support,
a /P parameter for TYPE for paused screens, an editable command stack like the
public domain DOSEDIT.COM utility, and could be set up to remain completely
resident in RAM instead of a resident/transient part like normal DOS.  It is a
pity some of the neat enhancements didn't make it into DOS 2.0.  IBM also had
an "internal use only" version 3.4, evidently used while developing DOS 4.0.

 Digital Research's DR-DOS is the first widely available DOS clone.  Version
3.4, released in June 1988, was the one first available to the American public.
It was somewhat buggy and its use is not recommended.  DR 3.41 is extremely
compatible and its use should pose no problems on any machine.  DR-DOS 5.0
(released May, 1990) is functionally equivalent to MS-DOS 5.0.  For all
practical purposes, MS 5.0 is a clone of DR 5.0, since DR beat MS to market by
over a year.  According to Greg Ewald, DRI's DR-DOS product manager, DR-DOS was
developed from Concurrent DOS 386 with the multiuser and multitasking code
stripped out.

 Some versions of DOS used in compatibles do not maintain the 1.x, 2.x, ...
numbering system.  Columbia Data Products computers labeled DOS 1.25 as DOS
2.0.  Early Compaqs labeled DOS 2.0 as DOS 1.x.  Other versions incorporated
special features - Compaq DOS 3.31 and Wyse DOS 3.21 both support &gt;32mb disk
partitions in the same fashion as DOS 4.x.

 AT&amp;T DOS 3.1 differs from generic MSDOS 3.10 in its use of cluster-size and
file allocation table structures.  AT&amp;T DOS appears to use rules not from
version 3, but rather those from version 2.

 Epson Equity III and ComputerLand 3.10 DOS's appear to use cluster techniques
that are a cross between versions 2 and 3.  On type DOS partitions, these DOS's
use 3.x rules if the partition is larger than 32,680 sectors in total size.
This implies 16 bit FAT entries as well.  On partitions below this size, they
will use 2.x rules, including the 12 bit FAT entries.

 Zenith DOS 3.x and Wyse DOS 3.2 have a builtin internal device driver to
handle up to 4 32Mb DOS partitions on a single hard disk. Wyse DOS 3.31 will
handle single partitions up to 512Mb with a 32-bit FAT.

 According to PC Week Magazine, July 4, 1988, Arabic versions of MSDOS are
shipping with a hardware copy-protection system from Rainbow Technologies.
This is similar to the short-lived system used by AutoCAD 2.52 and a very few
other MSDOS programs, where an adapter block is plugged into the parallel port
and software makes use of coded bytes within the block.  This type of copy
protection has been common on Commodore products for several years, where it is
called a "dongle."
 The AutoCAD dongle was defeated by a small program written within weeks of
version 2.52's debut.  Version 2.62 was released 3 months later, without the
dongle.  The DOS dongle will, however, prevent the system from booting at all
unless it is found.
 This makes the Arabic version of MSDOS the first copy-protected operating
system, a dubious distinction at best.  The modifications to the operating
system to support the dongle are not known at this time.  Frankly, it would
seem that burning the operating system into ROMs would be cheaper and simpler.

 Versions of DOS sold in Great Britain are either newer than those sold in the
US or use a different numbering system.  DOS 3.4, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 had
been released there between the US releases of 3.3 and 4.0.
 MSDOS 4.0 (eDOS) was introduced in mid-1987 in Europe (at SICOB in Paris and
sometime earlier by Apricot Computer in the UK).  It offered multitasking
provided applications were specially written for it.
 David Fraser (Microsoft UK Managing Director) is on record saying that "DOS
4.0 is unlikely to set the world alight and is of interest only to specific
OEMs who want its features for networking and communications."   Standard DOS
applications will run under DOS 4.x as a foreground task according to uncertain
information.  It differs from earlier versions only in allowing background tasks
to run.  For further information, see Chapter 4.

 Microsoft changed their OEM licensing agreements between DOS versions 2.x and
3.x.  OEM versions of DOS 3.x must maintain certain data areas and undocumented
functions in order to provide compatibility with the networking features of the
operating system.  For this reason, TSR programs will be much more reliable
when operating under DOS 3.x.

 Several versions of DOS have been modified to be run out of ROM.  The Sharp
PC5000 had MSDOS 1.25 in ROM, and the Toshiba 1000 and some Tandy 1000 models
have MSDOS 2.11 in ROM.  In mid September 1989 Microsoft introduced 3.21R ROMs
for laptops, and in early '90 Texas Instruments laptops were the first to get
the 3.3R ROMs.  Digital Research has also announced its DR-DOS 3.41 and 5.0 is
available in a ROM version and Award Software is marketing DOS cards to OEMs
as a plug-in to ISA-bus machines.

 IBM's release of DOS 4.0 (and the immediate subsequent release of a bugfix)
was a dubious step "forward."  DOS 4.0 was the first version of DOS to come with
a warranty; the catch is that IBM warranted it only for a very slim list of
IBM-packaged software.  4.0 had some minor EMS support, support for large hard
disks, and not much else.  With its voracious RAM requirements and lack of
compatibility with previous versions of DOS (many major software packages
crashed under DOS 4.0), plus the increase in price to a cool $150, there was
no great rush to go to that version of DOS.

 Microsoft undertook development of MSDOS 5.0 in early 1990, soliciting
input from Usenet, BIX, and Compuserve among others.  5.0 is a functional
clone of Digital Research's DR-DOS 5.0.  5.0's compatibility was assured
by what has been claimed as the largest beta-test program in history -
in his address to the Boston Computer Society, Bill Gates announced over
7,500 testers were involved.




THE OPERATING SYSTEM HIERARCHY����������������������������������������� 1**5


 The Disk Operating System (DOS) and the ROM BIOS serve as an insulating layer
between the application program and the machine, and as a source of services
to the application program.

  As the term 'system' might imply, DOS is not one program but a collection
of programs designed to work together to allow the user access to programs
and data.  Thus, DOS consists of several layers of "control"programs and a set
of "utility" programs.

 The system hierarchy may be thought of as a tree, with the lowest level being
the actual hardware.  The 8088 or V20 processor sees the computer's address
space as a ladder one byte wide and one million bytes long.  Parts of this
ladder are in ROM, parts in RAM, and parts are not assigned.  There are also
65,536 "ports" that the processor can use to control devices.

 The hardware is normally addressed by the ROM BIOS, which will always know
where everything is in its particular system.  The chips may usually also be
written to directly, by telling the processor to write to a specific address or
port.  This sometimes does not work as the chips may not always be at the same
addresses or have the same functions from machine to machine.



DOS STRUCTURE���������������������������������������������������������� 1**6

DOS consists of four components:

 * The boot record
 * The ROM BIOS interface  (IBMBIO.COM, DRBIOS.SYS, or IO.SYS)
 * The DOS program file    (IBMDOS.COM, DRBDOS.SYS, or MSDOS.SYS)
 * The command processor   (COMMAND.COM or aftermarket replacement)


* The Boot Record

 The boot record begins on track 0, sector 1, side 0 of every diskette prepared
by the DOS FORMAT command.  The boot record is placed on diskettes to produce an
error message if you try to start up the system with a nonsystem diskette in
drive A.  For hard disks, the boot record resides on the first sector of the DOS
partition.  All media supported by DOS use one sector for the boot record.


* Read Only Memory (ROM) BIOS Interface and Extensions

 The file IBMBIO.COM or IO.SYS is the interface module to the ROM BIOS.
This file provides a low-level interface to the ROM BIOS device routines and
may contain extensions or changes to the system board ROMs.  Some compatibles do
not have a ROM BIOS to extend, and load the entire BIOS from disk.  (Sanyo 55x,
Viasyn machines).  Some versions of MSDOS, such as those from Compaq's MS-DOS
and Digital Research's DRDOS 5.0, are named IBMBIO.COM but are not IBM files.

 These low-level interface routines include the instructions for performing
operations such as displaying information on the screen, reading the keyboard,
sending data out to the printer, operating the disk drives, and so on.  It is
the operating system's means of controlling the hardware.  IBMBIO.COM contains
any modifications or updates to the ROM BIOS that are needed to correct any
bugs or add support for other types of hardware such as new disk drives.  By
using IBMBIO.COM to update the ROM BIOS on the fly when the user turns on their
computer, IBM does not need to replace the ROM BIOS chip itself, but makes any
corrections through the cheaper and easier method of modifying the IBMBIO.COM
file instead.

 IBMBIO.COM also keeps track of hardware operations on an internal stack or
"scratch pad" area for the operating system to save information such as
addresses it will need, etc.  An example of the use for this stack can be seen
when running a program such as a word processor.  If you have told the word
processor to save your letter, it will write the data to your disk.  During this
time, if you start typing some more information, the keyboard generates a
hardware interrupt.  Since you don't want the process of writing the information
to the disk to be interrupted, DOS allocates a slot in the stack for the
keyboard's hardware interrupt and when it gets a chance, (probably after the
data has been written to the disk), it can process that interrupt and pick up
the characters you may have been typing.  The STACKS= command in DOS 3.2+'s
CONFIG.SYS file controls the number of stack frames available for this
purpose.

 IBMBIO.COM also reads your CONFIG.SYS file and installs any device drivers
(i.e. DEVICE=ANSI.SYS) or configuration commands it may find there.



* The DOS Program

 The actual DOS program is the file IBMDOS.COM or MSDOS.SYS.  It provides a high-
level interface for user (application) programs.  This program consists of file
management routines, data blocking/deblocking for the disk routines, and a
variety of built-in functions easily accessible by user programs.

 When a user program calls these function routines, they accept high-level
information by way of register and control block contents.  When a user program
calls DOS to perform an operation, these functions translate the requirement
into one or more calls to IBMBIO.COM, MSDOS.SYS or system hardware to complete
the request.

 This section is often referred to as the "kernel" by systems programmers.



* The Command Interpreter

 The command interpreter, COMMAND.COM, is the part you interact with on the
command line.  COMMAND.COM has three parts.  IBM calls them the "resident
portion", the "initialization portion" and the "transient portion".

 IBM's original documentation spoke of installing alternate command
interpreters (programs other than COMMAND.COM) with the SHELL= statement in
CONFIG.SYS.  Unfortunately, IBM chose not to document much of the interaction
between IBMDOS.COM and IBMBIO.COM.  By the time much of the interaction was
widely understood, many commercial software programs had been written to use
peculiarities of COMMAND.COM itself.

 Several programs exist that perform as actual "shells" by completely replacing
COMMAND.COM and substituting their own command interpreter to use with the
hidden DOS files.  Examples are Command Plus, a commercial package, and the
shareware 4DOS and FlexShell packages.  Both supply greatly enhanced batch
language and editing capabilities.

NOTE: DOS 3.3+ checks for the presence of a hard disk, and will default to
      COMSPEC=C:\.  Previous versions default to COMSPEC=A:\.  Under some DOS
      versions, if COMMAND.COM is not immediately available for reloading
      (i.e., swapping to a floppy with COMMAND.COM on it) DOS may crash.


Resident Portion:

 The resident portion resides in memory immediately following IBMDOS.COM and its
data area.  This portion contains routines to process interrupts 22h (Terminate
Address), 23h (Ctrl-Break Handler), and 24h (Critical Error Handler), as well as
a routine to reload the transient portion if needed.  For DOS 3.x, this portion
also contains a routine to load and execute external commands, such as files
with exensions of COM or EXE.

 When a program terminates, a checksum is used to determine if the application
program overlaid the transient portion of COMMAND.COM.  If so, the resident
portion will reload the transient portion from the area designated by COMSPEC=
in the DOS environment.  If COMMAND.COM cannot be found, the system will halt.

 All standard DOS error handling is done within the resident portion of
COMMAND.COM.  This includes displaying error messages and interpreting the
replies to the "Abort, Retry, Ignore, Fail?" message.

 Since the transient portion of COMMAND.COM is so large (containing the
internal commands and all those error messages), and it is not needed when the
user is running an application it can be overlaid that program if that
application needs the room.  When the application is through, the resident
portion of COMMAND.COM brings the transient portion back into memory to show
the prompt.  This is why you will sometimes see the message "Insert disk with
COMMAND.COM".  It needs to get the transient portion off the disk since it was
overlaid with the application program.

 The initialization portion of COMMAND.COM follows the resident portion and is
given control during the bootup procedure.  This section actually processes the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  It also decides where to load the user's programs when they
are executed.  Since this code is only needed during startup, it is overlaid by
the first program which COMMAND.COM loads.

 The transient portion is loaded at the high end of memory and it is the
command processor itself.  It interprets whatever the user types in at the
keyboard, hence messages such as "Bad command or file name" for when the user
misspells a command.  This portion contains all the internal commands (i.e.
COPY, DIR, RENAME, ERASE), the batch file processor (to run .BAT files) and
a routine to load and execute external commands which are either .COM or
.EXE files.

 The transient portion of COMMAND.COM produces the system prompt, (C&gt;), and
reads what the user types in from the keyboard and tries to do something with
it.  For any .COM or .EXE files, it builds a command line and issues an EXEC
function call to load the program and transfer control to it.



DOS INITIALIZATION����������������������������������������������������� 1**7

 The system is initialized by a software reset (Ctrl-Alt-Del), a hardware reset
(reset button), or by turning the computer on.  The Intel 80x8x series processors
always look for their first instruction at the end of their address space
(0FFFF0h) when powered up or reset.  This address contains a jump to the first
instruction for the ROM BIOS.

 Built-in ROM programs (Power-On Self-Test, or POST, in the IBM) check machine
status and run inspection programs of various sorts.  Some machines set up a
reserved RAM area with bytes indicating installed equipment (AT and PCjr).

 When the ROM BIOS finds a ROM on an adapter card, it lets that ROM take
control of the system so that it may perform any set up necessary to use the
hardware or software controlled by that ROM.  The ROM BIOS searches absolute
addresses C8000h through E0000h in 2K increments in search of a valid ROM.
A valid ROM is determined by the first few bytes in the ROM.  The ROM will have
the bytes 55h, AAh, a length indicator and then the assembly language
instruction to CALL FAR (to bring in a "FAR" routine).  A checksum is done on
the ROM to verify its integrity, then the BIOS performs the CALL FAR to bring
in the executible code.  The adapter's ROM then performs its initialization
tasks and hopefully returns control of the computer back to the ROM BIOS so it
can continue with the booting process.

 The ROM BIOS routines then look for a disk drive at A: or an option ROM
(usually a hard disk) at absolute address C:800h.  If no floppy drive or option
ROM is found, the BIOS calls int 19h (ROM BASIC if it is an IBM) or displays
an error message.

 If a bootable disk is found, the ROM BIOS loads the first sector of information
from the disk and then jumps into the RAM location holding that code.  This code
normally is a routine to load the rest of the code off the disk, or to "boot"
the system.

 The following actions occur after a system initialization:

 1.  The boot record is read into memory and given control.

 2.  The boot record then checks the root directory to assure that the first
     two files are IBMBIO.COM and IBMDOS.COM or their OEM equivalents.  These
     must be the first two files, and they must be in that order (IBMBIO.COM
     first, with its sectors in contiguous order).
     NOTE: IBMDOS.COM need not be contiguous in version 3.x+.

 3.  The boot record loads IBMBIO.COM into memory.

 4.  The initialization code in IBMBIO.COM loads IBMDOS.COM, determines
     equipment status, resets the disk system, initializes the attached
     devices, sets the system parameters and loads any installable device
     drivers according to the CONFIG.SYS file in the root directory (if
     present), sets the low-numbered interrupt vectors, relocates IBMDOS.COM
     downward, and calls the first byte of DOS.
     NOTE: CONFIG.SYS may be a hidden file.

 5.  DOS initializes its internal working tables, initializes the interrupt
     vectors for interrupts 20h through 27h, and builds a Program Segment
     Prefix for COMMAND.COM at the lowest available segment.  For DOS versions
     3.10 up, DOS also initializes the vectors for interrupts 0Fh through 3Fh.
     An initialization routine is included in the resident portion and assumes
     control during startup.  This routine contains the AUTOEXEC.BAT file
     handler and determines the segment address where user application programs
     may be loaded.  The initialization routine is then no longer needed and is
     overlaid by the first program COMMAND.COM loads.
     NOTE: AUTOEXEC.BAT may be a hidden file.

 6.  IBMDOS.COM uses the EXEC function call to load and start the top-level
     command processor.  The default command processor is COMMAND.COM in the
     root directory of the boot drive.  If COMMAND.COM is in a subdirectory
     or another command processor is to be used, it must be specified by a
     SHELL= statement in the CONFIG.SYS file.
     A transient portion is loaded at the high end of memory.  This is the
     command processor itself, containing all of the internal command
     processors and the batch file processor.  For DOS 2.x, this portion also
     contains a routine to load and execute external commands, such as files
     with extensions of COM or EXE.
      This portion of COMMAND.COM also produces the DOS prompt (such as "A&gt;"),
     reads the command from the standard input device (usually the keyboard or
     a batch file), and executes the command.  For external commands, it builds
     a command line and issues an EXEC function call to load and transfer
     control to the program.

note 1) COMMAND.COM may be a hidden file.
     2) For IBM DOS 2.x, the transient portion of the command processor
        contains the EXEC routine that loads and executes external commands.
        For MSDOS 2.x+ and IBM DOS 3.x+, the resident portion of the command
        processor contains the EXEC routine.
     3) IBMDOS only checks for a file named "COMMAND.COM".  It will load
        any file of that name if no SHELL= command is used.


 That pretty much covers the bootup process.  After the command processor is
loaded, it runs the AUTOEXEC.BAT file and then the user gets their prompt to
begin working.

 For consistency in this reference, all locations and offsets are in
hexadecimal unless otherwise specified. All hex numbers are prefaced with a
leading zero if they begin with an alphabetic character, and are terminated
with a lowercase H (h). The formats vary according to common usage.



System Memory Map ..................................................... 2**2

 The IBM PC handles its address space in 64k segments, divided into 16k
fractions and then further as necessary.

 Note that the ROM BIOS has a duplicated address space which causes it to
"appear" both at the end of the 1 megabyte real mode space and at the end of
the 16 megabyte protected mode space. The addresses from 0E0000 to 0FFFFF are
equal to 0FE0000 to 0FFFFFF. This is necessary due to differences in the memory
addressing between Real and Protected Modes.



A Brief Guide to Current Memory Terminology ........................... 2**3

LOW MEMORY - 0000h to around 0:5(something), comprising the 80x8x interrupt
             vector table, the BIOS Data Area, DOS Data Area, etc.

CONVENTIONAL MEMORY - from the end of low memory to the beginning of the
             "reserved by IBM" A000 segment (640k).

HIGH MEMORY - originally noncontiguous RAM stuffed into the "reserved for
             ROM expansion" areas, typically segments D000 and E000. DOS
             normally can't access this memory without a driver of some
             sort, but it's easy to put RAMdisks and stuff in there.

CONVENTIONAL MEMORY - extra RAM stuck at A000, assuming the machine already
             has 640k, appears as conventional memory accessible to DOS
             and applications. IBM clones can typically add 64k before
             bumping into a mono card or 96k before hitting a color card.
             This address is part of the EGA/VGA video RAM area and most
             EGA cards don't like system memory at A000.

EXPANDED MEMORY - LIM 3.2, LIM 4.0, or EEMS 3.2 bank switched memory. A
             RAM "window" allows an app to save a block of RAM to an expansion
             board. The window size and location varies according to the
             EMS standard being used.

EXTENDED MEMORY - this is the "native mode" address space of the 80286 and
             later chips. The "real mode", or 8088 addressing scheme,
             sees RAM as a collection of segments and offsets with a limit
             on segment size. "Protected mode" addressing uses a flat linear
             addressing scheme. 8088 and 80188 chips do not have extended
             memory.

HIGH MEMORY - by fiddling a bit with the segment/offset stuff, you can
             get an extra block of addressable 8088-mode memory just over
             the 1 meg address space. Microsoft issued their "HMA" (High
             Memory Area) standard to try to standardize use of this block.
             Though it really is "high" memory, "high" had for many years
             referred to memory between 640k and 1mb. This creates more
             confusion for new programmers.

EMS - this is expanded memory as described above

XMS - Microsoft is pushing an "Extended Memory Standard" which defines
      a page-switching scheme much like EMS. The only real difference is
      that XMS uses protected-mode RAM instead of a special paged RAM board.

XMS - some severely brain-damaged jerk at IBM issued documentation for some
      IBM *EMS* boards referring to the boards as *XMS*. This was a classic
      blunder, and now some IBM-followers are picking up the aberrant
      terminology. This is guaranteed to confuse some people. To make it
      simple, if it needs an expansion board, it is EMS no matter what the
      vendor calls it.


PC Port Assignment .................................................... 2**4


 These are functions common across the IBM range. The PCjr, PC-AT, PC
Convertible and PS/2 (both buses) have enhancements. In some cases, the
AT and PS/2 series ignore, duplicate, or reassign ports arbitrarily. If
your code incorporates specific port addresses for video or system board
control it would be wise to have your application determine the machine
type and video adapter and address the ports as required.

                        not use refresh at all. The PCjr refreshes by the
                        video vertical retrace signal.

The IBM PC System Interrupts (Overview) ............................... 2**7

 The interrupt table is stored in the very lowest location in memory, starting
at 0000:0000h. The locations are offset from segment 0, i.e. location 0000h has
the address for int 0, etc. The table is 1024 bytes in length and contains 256
four byte vectors from 00h to 0FFh. Each address' location in memory can be
found by multiplying the interrupt number by 4. For example, int 7 could be
found by (7x4=28) or 1Bh (0000:001Bh).

 These interrupt vectors normally point to ROM tables or are taken over by DOS
when an application is run. Some applications revector these interrupts to
their own code to change the way the system responds to the user. DOS provides
int 21h function 25h to change interrupts from a high level; altering the
interrupt vector table directly is not recommended, nor would it really get
you anywhere.

(0:0000h) (processor error). Automatically called at end of DIV or IDIV
          operation that results in error. Normally set by DOS to display an
          error message and abort the program.

note    On an 8086/8088, the return address points to the following instruction
        On an 80286/80386, the return address points to the divide instruction


�����������������������������������������������������������������������������Ŀ
�Interrupt  01h Single step                                                   �
�������������������������������������������������������������������������������
(0:0004h) Taken after every instruction when CPU Trap Flag indicates
          single-step mode (bit 8 of FLAGS is 1). This is what makes the "T"
          command of DEBUG work for single stepping. Is not generated after MOV
          to segment register or POP of segment register. (unless you have a
          very early 8088 with the microcode bug).

(0:0008h)       Vector not disabled via CLI. Generated by NMI signal in
                hardware. This function is called in the event of a memory
                parity error or may occur in the event of other hardware
                problems or failures depending on the specific manufacturer's
                hardware. Displays the appropriate error message and halts the
                processor.
                 Some AT chip sets apparently use int 02h to signal I/O errors
                as well as parity errors.

                This signal has various uses:
        POST parity error:                  all except PCjr and Convertible
        80x87 coprocessor interrupt:        all except PCjr and Convertible
        Keyboard interrupt:                 PCjr, Convertible
        I/O channel check:                  Convertible, PS/2 50+
        Disk controller power-on request:   Convertible
        System suspend:                     Convertible
        Realtime clock:                     Convertible
        System watchdog timer:              PS/2 50+
        Timeout interrupt:                  PS/2 50+
        DMA timer time-out interrupt:       PS/2 50+

(0:000Ch)  Taken when CPU executes the 1-byte int 3 (0CCh). Similar to 8080's

(internal) RST instruction. Generally used to set breakpoints for DEBUG.

note 1)  Also used by Turbo Pascal versions 1,2,3 when {$U+} specified.
     2)  Int 3s are sometimes inserted by the Microsoft Linker in response to
         an unresolved symbol.

�������������������������������������������������������������������������������
(0:0010h)  Generated by INTO instruction if OF flag is set. If flag is not set,

(internal) INTO is effectively a NOP. Used to trap any arithmetic errors when
           program is ready to handle them rather than immediately when they
           occur.


�����������������������������������������������������������������������������Ŀ
�Interrupt  05h Print Screen                                                  �

(0:0014h)  Service dumps the screen to the printer. Invoked by int 9 for shifted
           key 55 (PrtSc). Automatically called by keyboard scan when PrtSc key
           is pressed. Normally executes a routine to print the screen, but may
           call any routine that can safely be executed from inside the keyboard
           handler. Status and result byte are at address 0050:0000.

(internal) BOUND Check Failed (80286+)
           Generated by BOUND instruction when the value to be tested is less
           than the indicated lower bound or greater than the indicated upper
           bound.

        On the Tandy 1000TX this interrupt can be enabled or disabled across
        the expansion slots via a DIP switch.

(internal) No Math Unit Available (80286+)

note    The 80286 and later can be programmed to generate an int 7 whenever
        an ESC instruction is encountered. This could be used to emulate an
        80x87 series coprocessor in software and be transparent to the
        application software. It could also be used to make a non-Intel
        floating point processor emulate an 80x87.

(0:0020h)  55ms timer "tick" issued 18.2 times per second.
 (IRQ0)    8259-1 Interrupt Controller
           Updates the system time at [0040:006C] (low word) and [0040:006E]
           (high word) and issues an int 1Ch (timer). (int 1Ch points to an
           IRET instruction unless changed by a resident program). The timer
           interrupt is given the highest maskable interrupt priority upon
           power up.

(internal) Double Fault (80286+ protected mode) Called when multiple exceptions
           occur on one instruction, or an exception occurs in an exception
           handler. If an exception occurs in the double fault handler, the CPU
           goes into SHUTDOWN mode (which circuitry in the PC/AT converts to a
           reset).

entry   AH      08h

�������������������������������������������������������������������������������
(0:0024h)  Taken whenever a key is pressed or released. This is normally a scan
 (IRQ1)    code, but may also be an ACK or NAK of a command on AT-type
           keyboards. The hardware provides the key pressed in a non-ASCII scan
           code format read at I/O port 60h. The servicer acknowledges receipt
           of the key by toggling bit 7 of port 61h. (Port 61h should be read
           first, then bit 7 ORed on, output to port 61h, then ANDed off, and
           resent to port 61h).

            The read key is decoded to yield an ASCII character, special
           function key (such as F1) or a control function like Left Shift Key.
           The converted ASCII character is placed into the next available
           position in the circular queue keyboard. It is put in the position
           indicated by queue tail when it will not cause the loss of earlier
           entered data. The queue head points to the oldest key pressed in the
           buffer which has not been removed from the queue (the normal process
           uses int 16h to remove keys from the queue and return the key value
           to the int 16h caller).

            The 16 word queue holds up to 16 keys. If the queue head equals the
            queue tail, the queue is empty. Valid keys in the queue comprise
            the upper byte scan code and the lower byte ASCII character. If the
            key pressed has no ASCII equivalent (i.e F1 to F12), the lower byte
            is zero.

             Toggle and shift keys are not placed in the buffer, but appear in
           the two status bytes at absolute addr. [0040:0017,18].

           Special key combinations will cause other events to occur:
           a) Ctrl-Alt_Del  -  Reset computer by jumping to power_on_reset
           b) Print screen  -  Call int_5_prn_scrn to print the current screen
           c) Ctrl-Break    -  Call int_1Bh control break key processor (DOS)
           d) Pause         -  Wait until an ASCII key is pressed, without
                               placing the key in the queue

 (IRQ2)    8259-1 Interrupt Controller
note 1) The TOPS and PCnet adapters use this IRQ line by default.
     2) On systems equipped with 2 interrupt controller chips (8259), IRQ 2
        is used to support the second interrupt controller. In this case,
        int 71h (IRQ 9) is used to replace IRQ 2. Hardware calls to int 71h
        are redirected to this interrupt to maintain compatibility.
     3) Many VGA boards to not use this interrupt.

(0:002Ch)  Serial Port 2 (COM2) 8259-1
 (IRQ3)
note 1) IRQ 3 may be used by SDLC (synchronous data-link control) or
        bisynchronous communications cards instead of a serial port.
     2) The TOPS and PCnet adapters use this interrupt request line as an
        alternate.
     3) On PS/2s, COM2 through COM8 share this IRQ.
     4) For most serial boards, COM4 shares this IRQ.
     5) On the Commodore Amiga 2000 with the PC Bridge Board, this interrupt
        is used for communication between the Amiga system board and the
        Bridge Board. This was probably the lowest IRQ level they felt safe
        using, but limits the A2000's use of network cards, etc.
     6) This interrupt is used by part of the stack-switching code added
        to DOS 3.2 for use with Local Area Network adapters.
     7) The PS/2 puts COM3 through COM8 at port addresses above 3FFh (not
        properly decoded by older PCs) and has all of them sharing IRQ3.

(internal) Not Present (80286+ protected mode)
           Generated when loading a segment register if the segment descriptor

 The ROM BIOS is the lowest level of software access. It contains the
following routines:

   (all)
        power-on self-test (POST)
        boostrap loader
        clock
        floppy disk I/O
        video I/O
        keyboard
        serial ports
        parallel ports
        print screen
        equipment check
        report memory size


    (AT)
        hard disk I/O
        report memory size (extended memory)
        extended memory block moves
        enhanced video and keyboard I/O
        high resolution timer
        alarm

  Machines such as the PC Convertible, PCjr, and non-IBM machines add
additional functions.


Calling the ROM BIOS .................................................. 3**1

 The BIOS services are invoked by placing the number of the desired function in
register AH, subfunction in AL, setting the other registers to any specific
requirements of the function, and invoking any of ints 10h through int 1Fh.

 The original IBM PC Technical Reference gave the absolute addresses of the
ROM routines. Some early software jumped directly to these addresses, with
mixed results on non-IBM BIOSes. This practice was common on machines
predating the PC, but there is no practical use for it now. The OS/2
Compatibility Box also does not support jumping directly into the ROM.

 When the interrupt is called, all register and flag values are pushed into the
stack. The interrupt address contains a pointer into an absolute address in the
ROM BIOS chip address space. This location may be further vectored into the
IBMBIO.COM (or equivalent) file or user file.

 The address vector points to a particular BIOS command handler. The handler
pops the register values, compares them to its list of functions, and executes
the function if valid. When the function is complete, it may pass values back
to the command handler. The handler will push the values into the stack and
then return control to the calling program.

 Most functions will return an error code; some return more information.
Details are contained in the listings for the individual functions.

 Register settings listed are the ones used by the BIOS. Some functions will
return with garbage values in unused registers. Do not test for values in
unspecified registers; your program may exhibit odd behavior.


 Three sets of BIOS routines are available: PC BIOS, AT BIOS (also called
CBIOS or "Old compatibility BIOS", and the PS/2 ABIOS "Advanced BIOS".

 The Advanced BIOS is contained in PS/2 ROMs. It is primarily intended for OS
use rather than application use. OS/2 can take advantage of ABIOS routines to
reduce RAM use on PS/2 systems. The ABIOS can be replaced by disk and RAM based
ABIOS code if desired. There is a new BIOS Data Area defined in high memory
that occupies one K of RAM. In OS/2 systems, parts of the ABIOS are replaced
by OS/2 drivers.

 While the CBIOS must be addressed via pointers, the routines in the ABIOS are
fixed in absolute locations so they can be referenced directly by OS/2.

 The ABIOS can run in protected mode, and is fully reentrant. It supports three
types of function requests - single staged, discrete multistaged, or continuous
multistaged. A single-staged request does its job immediately and returns
control to the caller. A discrete multistaged request may happen in two or more
stages with pauses between the stages. The caller may regain control during the
pauses. A continuous multistaged request starts a staged operation that never
ends. (sometimes called a daemon).

 Unlike the CBIOS which is called with software interrupts, ABIOS is accessed
with FAR calls. ABIOS calls are completely reentrant in both real and
protected modes. To call an ABIOS function, the calling program must pass
pointers to two data structures - a request block and a common data area. The
request block specifies the desired function number and the common data area is
a table that contains pointers to all the ABIOS' other tables and data areas.
The common data area's internal structure contains the function transfer
tables which have the addresses of the BIOS routines.

ABIOS stack frame and calling conventions:
       bytes        stack contents
        2       common data area pointer (segment/selector only) required
        4       request block pointer - required
        4       function transfer table pointer - furnished by ABIOS or caller
        4       device block pointer - furnished by ABIOS or caller
        4       return address

 In ABIOS Transfer Convention, only the first two items are required. ABIOS
assigns the second two. In Operating System Transfer Convention, the caller
provides the second two. Since the parameters are not removed from the stack
on return to the caller, the operating system may save the function transfer
table and device addresses after they have been furnished by the ABIOS by a
call.

 ABIOS does no interrupt arbitration. It assumes all interrupts are handled by
the caller or the OS and it is called only for service. If more than one
device is sharing a hardware interrupt, the OS must determine which interrupt
is valid for the ABIOS.

 OS/2 may use the ABIOS if found, but otherwise duplicates the BIOS calls for
the DOS Compatibility Box by vectoring BIOS calls into its own device drivers.
This makes it rather difficult for DOS drivers for mass storage, high
resolution video boards, multitasking APIs using int 15h, etc. If your
software needs to manipulate hardware directly you might want to check if your
code is running under OS/2. The simplest method is to check for DOS version 10
or higher.


note    Some references list an "XT/2" machine, which was reputedly an 8mHz
        8088 with 640k and a clock on the motherboard. IBM doesn't list such
        a machine, and I have a late '86 XT, one of the last made. It is
        pretty much like the older ones.

 Note:  Some IBM PS/2 Model 50Z machines were delivered with serial ports
        that did not meet specification.  Some cheap clone serial ports may
        also be troublesome.

(0:0050h)       the following status is defined:

                2 trailing edge ring detector
                3 delta receive line signal detect
                4 clear to send
                5 data set ready
                6 ring indicator
                7 receive line signal detect

        line status byte:
        bits    0 data ready
                1 overrun error
                2 parity error

                6 transmit shift register empty
                7 time out  note: if bit 7 set then other bits are invalid

        Though present on the IBM PS/2s, COM3 and COM4 are not widely
        standardized across the industry. The most common definitions are:

        port    addr.   IRQ     interrupt

        COM1    3F8     IRQ4    int 0Ch
        COM2    2F8     IRQ3    int 0Bh
        COM3    3E8     IRQ4    int 0Ch
        COM4    2E8     IRQ3    int 0Bh

        As you can see, COM1/COM3 and COM2/COM4 are siamesed.  Since the ISA
        bus does not support shared interrupts, simultaneous access of two of
        a pair may cause conflict.  For example, a mouse and a modem would not
        coexist well on paired ports.


 All routines have AH=function number and DX=RS232 card number (0 based).
AL=character to send or received character on exit, unless otherwise noted.

entry   AH      04h     Initialize FOSSIL driver
        BX      4F50h                      (optional)

        BL      maximum function number supported (excluding 7Eh-0BFh)
        BH      revision of FOSSIL supported
note 1) DTR is raised when FOSSIL inits.
     2) Existing baudrate is preserved.
     3) If BX contains 4F50h, the address specified in ES:CX is that of a ^C
        flag byte in the application program, to be incremented when ^C is
        detected in the keyboard service routines. This is an optional service
        and only need be supported on machines where the keyboard service can't
        (or won't) perform an int 1Bh or int 23h when a control-C is entered.


entry   AH      05h     Deinitialize FOSSIL driver

return  none
note 1) DTR is not affected.
     2) Disengages driver from comm port. Should be done when operations on the
        port are complete.
     3) If DX=00FFh, the initialization that was performed when FOSSIL function
        04h with DX=00FFh should be undone.

entry   AH      09h     FOSSIL: Purge output buffer

note    Returns to caller immediately.


entry   AH      0Ah     FOSSIL: Purge input buffer
        DX      port number (NOP if DX=00FFh)
return  none
note 1) If any flow control restraint has been employed (dropping RTS or
        transmitting XOFF) the port will be "released" by doing the reverse,
        raising RTS or sending XON.
     2) Returns to caller immediately.


entry   AH      0Bh     FOSSIL: Transmit no wait
        AL      ASCII character value to be sent

return  AX      0000h   character not accepted
                0001h   character accepted
note    This is exactly the same as the "regular" transmit call except that if
        there is no space available in the output buffer a value of zero is
        returned in AX, if room is available a value 1 (one) is returned.


entry   AH      0Ch     FOSSIL: Nondestructive Read no Wait
        DX      port number (NOP if DX=00FFh)
return  AH      character
                0FFFFh  character not available
note 1) Reads async buffer.
     2) Does not remove keycode from buffer.


entry   AH      0Dh     FOSSIL: Keyboard read no wait
return  AX      IBM keyboard scan code or
                0FFFFh if no keyboard character available
note 1) Use IBM-style function key mapping in the high order byte.
     2) Scan codes for non function keys are not specifically required but may
        be included.
     3) Does not remove keycode from buffer.


entry   AH      0Eh     FOSSIL: Keyboard input with wait
return  AX      IBM keyboard scan code
note    Returns the next character from the keyboard or waits if no character
        is available.


entry   AH      0Fh     Enable or Disable flow control
        AL      bit mask describing requested flow control
           bits 0       XON/XOFF on transmit (watch for XOFF while sending)
                1       CTS/RTS (CTS on transmit/RTS on receive)
                2       reserved
                3       XON/XOFF on receive (send XOFF when buffer near full)
                4-7     not used, FOSSIL spec calls for setting to 1
        DX      port number (NOP if DX=00FFh)
return  none
note 1) Bit 2 is reserved for DSR/DTR,  but is not currently supported in any
        implementation.
     2) TRANSMIT flow control allows the other end to restrain the transmitter
        when you are overrunning it. RECEIVE flow control tells the FOSSIL to
        attempt to do just that if it is being overwhelmed.
     3) Enabling transmit Xon/Xoff will cause the FOSSIL to stop transmitting
        upon receiving an Xoff. The FOSSIL will resume transmitting when an Xon
        is received.
     4) Enabling CTS/RTS will cause the FOSSIL to cease transmitting when CTS
        is lowered. Transmission will resume when CTS is raised. The FOSSIL
        will drop RTS when the receive buffer reaches a predetermined
        percentage full. The FOSSIL will raise RTS when the receive buffer
        empties below the predetermined percentage full. The point(s) at which
        this occurs is left to the individual FOSSIL implementor.
     5) Enabling receive Xon/Xoff will cause the FOSSIL to send a Xoff when the
        receive buffer reaches a pre-determined percentage full. An Xon will be
        sent when the receive buffer empties below the predetermined percentage
        full. The point(s) at which this occurs is left to the individual
        FOSSIL implementor.
     6) Applications using this function should set all bits ON in the high
        nibble of AL as well. There is a compatible (but not identical) FOSSIL
        driver implementation that uses the high nibble as a control mask. If
        your application sets the high nibble to all ones, it will always work,
        regardless of the method used by any given driver.

return  none
note 1) This function looks exactly like the int 10h, fn 02h on the IBM PC.
        The cursor location is passed in DX: row in DH and column in DL. This
        function treats the screen as a coordinate system whose origin (0,0) is
        the upper left hand corner of the screen.
     2) Row and column start at 0.


entry   AH      12h     FOSSIL: Read current cursor location.
return  DH      row (line)

note 1) Looks exactly like int 10h/fn 03h in the IBM PC BIOS. The current
        cursor location (same coordinate system as function 16h) is passed back
        in DX.
     2) Row and column start at 0.

return  none
note 1) This call will cause the FOSSIL to reboot the system if Carrier Detect
        for the specified port drops while watchdog is turned on.
     2) The port need not be active for this function to work.


entry   AH      15h     Write character to screen using BIOS support routines

note 1) This function does not wait for more characters to become available if
        the value in CX exceeds the number of characters currently stored.
     2) ES:DI are left unchanged by the call; the count of bytes actually
        transferred will be returned in AX.

                                (see mask in function 00h
note 1) The baud rate byte contains the bits that fn 00h would use to set the
        port to that speed.
     2) The fields related to a particular port (buffer size, space left in the
        buffer, baud rate) will be undefined if port=0FFh or an invalid port is
        contained in DX.
     3) Additional information will always be passed after these, so that the
        fields will never change with FOSSIL revision changes.

(0:0054h)    1) Renamed "System Services" on PS/2 line.
             2) Issuing int 15h on an XT may cause a system crash.
                On AT and after, interrupts are disabled with CLI when the
                interrupt service routine is called, but most ROM versions do
                not restore interrupts with STI.
             3) For the original IBM PC, int 15h returns AH=80h and CF set for
                all calls with AH not 0,1, or 2.
             4) For the PC/XT int 15h returns AH=86h, CF set if called at all.
                (the PC/XT ROM BIOS does not support int 15h)
             5) For the AT/339, int 15h returns AH=86h, CF set if called with
                an invalid function code.

note 1) Called the BIOS on the ESDI Fixed Disk Drive Adapter/A during a format
        or surface analysis operation after each cylinder is completed.
     2) This function call can be captured by a program so that it will be
        notified as each cylinder is formatted or analyzed. The program can
        count interrupts for each phase to determine the current cylinder
        number.
     3) The BIOS default handler for this function returns with CF set.

                clear   scan code should not be used
note 1) Called by int 9 handler for each keystroke to translate scan codes.
     2) An OS or a TSR can capture this function to filter the raw keyboard
        data stream. The new handler can substitute a new scan code, return the
        same scan code, or return the carry flag clear causing the keystroke to
        be discarded. The BIOS default routine simply returns the scan code
        unchanged.
     3) A program can call int 15h/fn0C0h to determine whether the host
        machine's BIOS supports keyboard intercept.
     4) Used internally by PC-MOS/386 v4.00+ for keyboard input.
     5) Some BIOSes do not properly support this call. However, some versions
        of KEYB.COM provide additional 4Fh support.


Function 52h    MicroSoft RAM-Resident Software Specification 1.0
                This standard was proposed by MicroSoft in 1986 as a common
                interface for TSR programs. It appears to have been largely
                unknown or disregarded.

Function 0: Get Program Information by Name
entry   DS:BX   The Program ID of the memory-resident program to look for
return  AL      0FFh    if the program we are looking for is installed
                00h     if it is not installed
        CX      The number of this program. The first program installed is
                number 0, with the second program being number 1, etc. By using
                a dynamic numbering system, we avoid conflicts between programs
                that might otherwise choose the same ID. We also provide a good
                way to scan all the resident programs using function 1.
        ES:DX   pointer to the Program ID Record (PIDR)
note    This function tests to see if a program is memory resident and returns
        a pointer to its program information if it is resident. To use this
        function, set DS:BX to point to the program ID. Each installed program
        will check to see if this program ID agrees with its own internal
        program ID.

Function 1: Get Program Information by Number
entry   CX      Number of the program we want the information for

return  AL      0FFh    if the program we are looking for is installed
                00h     if it is not installed
        ES:DX   pointer to the Program ID Record (PIDR)
note    This function returns exactly the same information as function 0. The
        only difference is how we identify the program we want, which is
        determined by its position in the interrupt chain; program 0 is the
        last program in the chain, and the first program in the chain (usually
        the most recently installed) has the highest number.

Function 2: Activate Program
entry   CX      The number of the program we want to activate
        DS:BX   Activation Record. This record will give program information on
                how and what it should activate within the program
return  none
note    This function activates one of the installed programs. It is useful
        if you want to control many desk accessories with a single control
        panel like the one used in SideKick. You can also use it with a
        program like ProKey to run a named macro under program control, or
        with SideKick to bring up one of the desk accessories from within a
        program or batch file.

Function 3: Deactivate Program
entry   CX      The number of the program we want to deactivate
        DS:BX   Deactivation Record. This record will give program information
                on how and what it should deactivate within the program
return  none
note    This function is the opposite of function 2 (activate program).

Function 4: Enable Program
entry   CX      The number of the program we want to enable
        DS:BX   Enable mask record. This mask describes what features we want
                to enable. A null record enables all the features.
return  none
note    This function is the opposite of function 5 (disable program).

Function 5: Disable Program
entry   CX      The number of the program we want to disable
        DS:BX   Disable mask record.  This mask describes what features we want
                to disable. A null record disables all the features.
return  none
note    Sometimes it becomes necessary to disable a program to prevent it from
        conflicting with another program, this function is designed to do that.
        This function is the opposite of function 4 (Enable Program).

        BX      device ID
        CX      process ID
return  CF      set on error
        AH      status
note 1) Acquires ownership of a logical device for a process.
     2) This call, along with fns 81h and 82h, defines a simple protocol that
        can be used to arbitrate usage of devices by multiple processes. A
        multitasking program manager would be expected to capture int 15h and
        provide the appropriate service.
     3) The default BIOS routine for this function simply returns with CF clear
        and AH=00h.


Function 81h    Device Close                               (AT, XT/286, PS/2)

        BX      device ID
        CX      process ID
return  CF      set on error
        AH      status
note 1) Releases ownership of a logical device for a process.
     2) A multitasking program manager would be expected to capture int 15h and
        provide the appropriate service.
     3) The BIOS default routine for this function simply returns with the CF
        clear and AH=00h.


Function 82h    Program Termination                          (AT, XT/286, PS/2)
        AH      82h
        BX      device ID
return  CF      set on error
        AH      status
note 1) Closes all logical devices opened with function 80h.
     2) A multitasking program manager would be expected to capture int 15h and
        provide the appropriate service.
     3) The BIOS default routine for this function simply returns with CF clear
        and AH=00h.


Function 83h    Event Wait                 (AT, XT/286, Convertible, PS/2 50+)
entry   AH      83h
        AL      00h     to set interval
                01h     to cancel
        CX:DX   number of microseconds to wait (granularity is 976 microseconds)
        ES:BX   pointer to semaphore flag (bit 7 is set when interval expires)
                (pointer is to caller's memory) (some sources list bit 15 set)
return  CF      clear   OK
                set     function already busy
note 1) Requests setting of a semaphore after a specified interval or cancels a
        previous request.
     2) The calling program is responsible for clearing the semaphore before
        requesting this function.
     3) The actual duration of an event wait is always an integral multiple of
        976 microseconds. The CMOS date/clock chip interrupts are used to
        implement this function.
     4) Use of this function allows programmed, hardware-independent delays at
        a finer resolution than can be obtained through use of the MS-DOS Get
        Time function (int 21h/fn 2Ch) which returns time in hundredths of a
        second.
     5) CX:DX is a four-byte integer.
     7) This function is called by int 70h and is not the normal Int 08h/1Ch
        clock tick. It is generated by the MC146818A Real Time Clock chip.
        This is the battery backed up CMOS clock chip.

        CX      stick B (X) value
        DX      stick B (Y) value
note 1) An error is returned if DX does not contain a valid subfunction number.
     2) If no game adapter is installed, all returned values are 00h.
     3) Using a 250K Ohm joystick, the potentiometer values usually lie within
        the range 0-416 (0000h-01A0h).


Function 85h    System Request (SysReq) Key Pressed        (except PC, PCjr, XT)
entry   AH      85h
        AL      00h      key pressed
                01h      key released
return  CF      set on error
        AH      error code
note 1) Called by BIOS keyboard decode routine when the SysReq key is detected.
     2) The BIOS handler for this call is a dummy routine that always returns a
        success status unless called with an invalid subfunction number in AL.
     3) A multitasking program manager would be expected to capture int 15h so
        that it can be notified when the user strikes the SysReq key.


Function 86h    Delay                                 (except PC, PCjr, XT)
        AH      86h
        CX:DX   4-byte integer, number of microseconds to wait
                CX high word, DX low word
return  CF      clear   after wait elapses
        CF      set     immediately due to error
note 1) Suspends the calling program for a specified interval in microseconds.
     2) The actual duration of the wait is always an integral multiple of 976
        microseconds.
     3) Use of this function allows programmed, hardware-independent delays at
        a finer resolution than can be obtained through use of the MS-DOS Get
        Time function (int 21h fn 2Ch) which returns time in hundredths of a
        second).
     4) This function calls int 70h and is not the normal Int 08h/1Ch
        clock tick. It is generated by the MC146818A Real Time Clock chip.
        This is the battery backed up CMOS clock chip.

note 1) The GDT table is composed of six 8-byte descriptors to be used by the
        CPU in protected mode. The four descriptors in offsets 00h-0Fh and
        20h-2Fh are filled in by the BIOS before the CPU mode switch.
     2) The addresses used in the descriptor table are linear (physical)
        24-bit addresses in the range 000000h-0FFFFFFh - not segments and
        offsets - with the least significant byte at the lowest address and the
        most significant byte at the highest address.
     3) Interrupts are disabled during this call; use may interfere with the
        operation of comm programs, network drivers, or other software that
        relies on prompt servicing of hardware interrupts.
     4) This call is not valid in the OS/2 Compatibility Box.
     5) This call will move a memory block from any real or protected mode
        address to any other real or protected mode address.
     6) DESQview does not intercept function 87, but QEXT and QEMM do, thereby
        allowing function 87 to work correctly inside DV.  VDISK, which uses
        function 87, works inside DV.  If VDISK is sitting at the 1 MB mark,
        then the int 19h vector will have a VDISK signature in it.  The normal
        way to check for VDISK presence is by checking for the string "VDISK"
        at offset 12h of the segment of the int 19h vector.  If the string
        matches, then you can determine how much extended memory is reserved
        for VDISK by looking at offset 2Ch is the 3-byte address of the lowest
        extended memory address NOT in use by VDISK (i.e. if you see at 2Ch
        "00 00 14" then that means that VDISK is using memory up to 1 MB +
        256K).


Function 88h    Get Extended Memory Size                   (AT, XT/286, PS/2)

return  AX      number of contiguous 1K blocks of extended memory starting at
                address 1024k
note 1) This call will not work in the OS/2 Compatibility Box.
     2) Some BIOSes and software manipulate the Carry Flag when this function
        is called. When tested on a vanilla 386 with AMI BIOS the machine
        returned with the carry flag set. When 386-to-the-Max was loaded, the
        flag was not set.
     3) Used by IBM VDISK 4.0.

note 1) The user must initialize the first seven descriptors; the eighth is
        filled in by the BIOS to provide addressability for its own execution.
        The calling program may modify and use the eighth descriptor for any
        purpose after return from this function call.

     4) The BIOS printer routine does not invoke this function because printer
        output is not interrupt driven.
     5) A multitasking program manager would be expected to capture int 15h/

(0:0058h)       Access the keyboard. Scancodes are found in Appendix 1. ASCII
                codes are found in Appendix 2.

                IBM's original keyboard layout is referred to as the 84-key
                or "old style". It has the function keys on the left and an
                embedded cursor/numeric keypad on the right. The 101-key "new
                style" or "enhanced" keyboard (such as used on the PS/2s) adds
                several keys. The early BIOS will not detect the new scancodes
                and the new BIOS for some reason added new function calls for
                this purpose instead of enhancing the old ones. This causes
                some hassle when writing programs which need to support both
                keyboards fully. Most programs limit themselves to the 84-key
                functions in the interest of backward compatibility.

                The SWITCHES CONFIG.SYS command forces DOS 4.0 to use the
                standard int 16h requests for keyboard I/O rather than the
                extended int 16h requests.

                The DOS KEYB command does not hook into the BIOS. It is a total
                replacement for the BIOS int9 driver. The only good thing about
                this is that you can use 101-key keyboards on old ATs without
                support for enhanced keyboards. KEYB is very peculiar in its
                handling of the keyboard, causing some programs to break. It
                also tends to disable interrupts for a long time while process-
                ing each scan code.

                There are machines such as the Toshiba 5200 which have 84-key
                layouts but "simulate" being 101-key, at least as far as int 16
                goes.  (always good for confusing your software...)

note 1) Keystroke is not removed from buffer. The same character and scan code
        will be returned by the next call to Int 16h/fn 00h.

     2) Subfunction 0 (Return to Default Keyboard State) restores the keyboard
        to its original state. The original state at power-on is typematic on,
        normal initial delay and normal typematic rate.
     3) Subfunction 1 (Increase Initial Delay) increases the delay between the
        first character typed and the burst of typematic characters.
     4) For Subfunctions 0 through 4, each time the typematic rate is changed,
        all previous states are removed.
     5) Some clone keyboards (Northgate Omnikey and Focus) have much higher
        repeat rates for the same bit values.

        In 1988 Borland sent me a letter saying they were still working on it.
        In late 1989 the Borland rep on BIX told me basically that there were
        no plans for releasing the API any more. The information here was
        dredged from Chris Dunford's LSPELL.PAS interface into Lighting.

(0:005Ch)       access the parallel printer(s)
                AH is changed. All other registers left alone.

                Printer ports vary widely in compatibility, since the original
                IBM MDA's parallel port did not match its own spec.  Many
                parallel ports do not use IRQ7 at all.

                The parallel port on a monochrome adapter is at 3BCh.  The port
                on a parallel printer adapter is at 378h or 278h.  At boot time,
                the BIOS looks at them in the order 3BCh, 378h, 278h, and
                assigns the first port it finds to LPT1, the second to LPT2,
                etc.  If you have a monochrome adapter, LPT1 is probably 3BCh;
                otherwise, it is probably 378h.

                                take more data because it is in the middle of
                                accepting a character, printing a line, is
                                offline, or it is in error status.

                    line on the printer port at the moment the status was read.
                    ACK is a strobe: it goes low for a very short time (12
                    microseconds on an Epson) when the printer is ready for
                    another character. As far as printer status is concerned,
                    this is useless; it's only useful for something like an
                    interrupt-driven interface. Most of the time, you'll see
                    ACK high (bit 6 on), but occasionally, if you check status
                    just after sending a character, you might see it low.
                    ACK is low when the printer is powered off.

                    is usually a button on the printer to control this.

                    such as out of ribbon.
                2   unused
                1   unused
                0   timeout error: printer failed to send ACK and drop busy
                    after being sent a character.
note 1) You can expect to see these states in a properly functioning printer:
        Normal                Offline                Power off
        ======                =======                =========

        not timeout error     not timeout error      not timeout error
     2) Not all printers return the status codes properly. That's OK, not all
        clone BIOS do it right either. If your program depends on the return
        codes, you might want to make the code easily patched or configured
        for nonstandard hardware.

entry   no parameters used
return  jumps into ROM BASIC on IBM systems
note 1) Often reboots a compatible.
     2) Used by Turbo C 1.5. 2.0 and later do not use it.
     3) On IBM systems, this interrupt is called if disk boot failure occurs.
     4) Video interrupt on DEC Rainbow.
     5) Digital Research's ROM-based implementation of DR-DOS uses int 18h as
        the initial entry vector into the operating system code. Note that
        some clone BIOSes may not properly implement int 18h in the ROM and
        use of DR-DOS ROMs may not always work.
     6) Maxon 286/HD laptop: called by BIOS power management routines to
        communicate with applications.

�������������������������������������������������������������������������������
(0:0064h)
entry   no parameters used
return  none
note 1) Reads track 0, sector 1 into address 0000h:7C00h, then transfers
        control to that address. If no diskette drive available, looks at
        absolute address C:800 for a valid hard disk or other ROM. If none,
        transfers to ROM-BASIC via int 18h or displays loader error message.
     2) Causes reboot of disk system if invoked while running. (no memory test
        performed).
     3) If location 0000:0472h does not contain the value 1234h, a memory test
        (POST) will be performed before reading the boot sector.
     4) VDISK from DOS 3.0+ traps this vector to determine when the CPU has
        shifted from protected mode to real mode. A detailed discussion can
        be found by Ray Duncan in PC Magazine, May 30, 1989.
     5) Reportedly, some versions of DOS 2.x and all versions of DOS 3.x+
        intercept int 19h in order to restore some interrupt vectors DOS takes
        over, in order to put the machine back to a cleaner state for the
        reboot, since the POST will not be run on the int 19h. These vectors
        are reported to be: 02h, 08h, 09h, 0Ah, 0Bh, 0Ch, 0Dh, 0Eh, 70h, 72h,
        73h, 74h, 75h, 76h, and 77h. After restoring these, it restores the
        original int 19h vector and calls int 19h.
     6) The system checks for installed ROMs by searching memory from 0C000h to
        the beginning of the BIOS, in 2k chunks. ROM memory is identified if it
        starts with the word 0AA55h. It is followed a one byte field length of
        the ROM (divided by 512). If ROM is found, the BIOS will call the ROM
        at an offset of 3 from the beginning. This feature was not supported in
        the earliest PC machines. The last task turns control over to the
        bootstrap loader (assuming the floppy controller is operational).
     7) 8255 port 60h bit 0 = 1 if booting from diskette.

(0:0068h)    1) Accesses the PC internal clock.
             2) This interrupt is not supported on some machines, such as
                the HP150 PC.
             3) Some "turbo" BIOSes run the clock slower than normal in order
                to throw off benchmark software, which usually uses int 1Ah
                for timekeeping.
             4) Counts occur at the rate of 1193180/65536 counts/sec (about
                18.2 per second).

Function 00h    Read System Timer Tick Counter                 (except PC)
entry   AH      00h
return  AL      00h     if clock was read or written (via AH=0,1) within the
                        current 24-hour period.
                &lt;&gt;0     midnight was passed since last read
        CX:DX   32-bit tick count (high 16 bits in CX)
note 1) The returned value is the cumulative number of clock ticks since
        midnight. There are 18.2 clock ticks per second, or one every 54.92ms.
        When the counter reaches 1,573,040, it is cleared to zero, and the
        rollover flag is set.
     2) The rollover flag is cleared by this function call, so the flag will
        only be returned nonzero once per day.
     3) Int 1Ah/fn 01h can be used to set the counter to an arbitrary 32 bit
        value.
     4) This function does not return seconds/100 in DL. The best you can do
        is set it to zero (or any value &lt;=99). This means that your DOS clock
        could be up to 1 second off from the BIOS clock, however the effect is
        not cumulative.


Function 01h    Set Clock Tick Counter Value                    (except PC)
entry   AH      01h
        CX:DX   32-bit high word/low word count of timer ticks
return  none
note 1) The clock ticks are incremented by timer interrupt at 18.2065 times
        per second or 54.9254 milliseconds/count. Therefore:
                counts per second   18      (12h)
                counts per minute   1092    (444h)
                counts per hour     65543   (10011h)
                counts per day      1573040 (1800B0h)
     2) The counter is zeroed when system is rebooted.
     3) Stores a 32-bit value in the clock tick counter.
     4) The rollover flag is cleared by this call.

note 1) Reads the current time from the CMOS time/date chip.
     2) Also for Leading Edge Model M.
     3) According to Phoenix this call will fail if the BIOS is "updating" its
        clock value. You should check the carry flag and retry if it is set
        following the call.

note 1) Reads the current date from the CMOS time/date chip.
     2) Also for Leading Edge Model M.

note 1) Sets the date in the CMOS time/date chip.
     2) Also for Leading Edge Model M.


Function 06h    Set Real Time Clock Alarm                       (AT and after)

        CL      minutes in BCD
        DH      seconds in BCD
return  CF      set if alarm already set or clock inoperable
note 1) Sets alarm in the CMOS date/time chip. Int 4Ah occurs at specified
        alarm time every 24hrs until reset with Int 1Ah/fn 07h.
     2) A side effect of this function is that the clock chip's interrupt
        level (IRQ8) is enabled.
     3) Only one alarm may be active at any given time.
     4) The program using this function must place the address of its interrupt
        handler for the alarm in the vector for Int 4Ah.


Function 07h    Reset Real Time Clock Alarm                     (AT and after)

�������������������������������������������������������������������������������
(0:006Ch)       This interrupt is called when the keyboard handler of the IBM
                machines detects Ctrl and Break pressed at the same time. DOS
                normally point this interrupt at its own Ctrl-Break handler.

note 1) If the break occurred while processing an interrupt, one or more
        end of interrupt commands must be send to the 8259 Programmable
        Interrupt Controller.
     2) All I/O devices should be reset in case an operation was underway at
        the time.
     3) It is normally pointed to an IRET during system initialization so that
        it does nothing, but some programs change it to return a Ctrl-C scan
        code and thus invoke int 23h.

note 1) Taken 18.2065 times per second by the int 08h interrupt.
     2) Normally vectors to dummy IRET unless PRINT.COM has been installed.
     3) If an application moves the interrupt pointer, it is the responsibility
        of that application to save and restore all registers that may be
        modified.

     5) Ventura Publisher 2.0 grabs this interrupt and does not pass subsequent
        vector reassignments along. This causes problems with some TSRs and
        network software.
     6) When installing a user interrupt for int 1Ch, the external interrupts
        must be disabled before the vector is altered. If a timer interrupt
        occurs between the setting of the offset and segment, an incorrect
        address will result.

note 1) This vector is pointed to the ROM BIOS diskette tables on system
        initialization
     2) IBM recommends that if this table needs to be modified, it should be
        copied into RAM and only the necessary changes made.
     3) Some versions of DOS 3.2 may contain a bug. DOS 3.2 assumes that the
        dword at 0070:0F37 contains the address of the diskette parameter
        block and changes values in that block. The location does contain a
        copy of the value at 0:78 (int 1Eh, DISK_POINTER) if DOS is booted from
        diskette, but when booted from the hard disk, the location contains
        0:0. This leads to strange things, especially when running under a
        debugger since DOS overwrites parts of the interrupt vectors for
        interrupts 1 to 3. The solution to the problem is to either upgrade
        to DOS 3.3 or to copy the disk parameter vector to 70:0F37 before
        running or at the start of your program.

 These registers, pointers, and flags are "lowest common denominator" 8088-8086
CPU oriented. DOS makes no attempt to use any of the special or enhanced
instructions availible on the later CPUs which will execute 8088 code, such as
the 80186, 80286, 80386, or NEV V20, V30, V40, or V50.

 When DOS takes control after a function call, it switches to an internal
stack. Registers which are not used to return information (other than AX) are
preserved. The calling program's stack must be large enough to accomodate the
interrupt system - at least 128 bytes in addition to other interrupts.
 DOS actually maintains three stacks -
stack 1: 384 bytes (in DOS 3.1)
         for functions 00h and for 0Dh and up, and for ints 25h and 26h.

stack 2: 384 bytes (in DOS 3.1)
         for function calls 01h through 0Ch.

stack 3: 48 bytes (in DOS 3.1)
         for functions 0Dh and above. This stack is the initial stack used by
         the int 21h handler before it decides which of the other two to use.
         It is also used by function 59h (get extended error), and 01h to 0Ch if
         they are called during an int 24h (critical error) handler. Functions
         33h (get/set break flag), 50h (set process ID), 51h (get process ID)
         and 62h (get PSP address) do not use any DOS stack under DOS 3.x
         (under 2.x, 50h and 51h use stack number 2).

 IBM and Microsoft made a change back in DOS 3.0 or 3.1 to reduce the size of
DOS. They reduced the space allocated for scratch areas when interrupts are
being processed. The default seems to vary with the DOS version and the
machine, but 8 stack frames seems to ring a bell. That means that if you get
more than 8 interrupts at the same time, clock, disk, printer spooler,
keyboard, com port, etc., the system will crash. It seems to happen usually on
a network. STACKS=16,256 means allow 16 interrupts to interrupt each other and
allow 256 bytes for each for scratch area. Eight is marginal.

 DOS 3.2 does some different stack switching than previous versions. The
interrupts which are switched are 02h, 08h, 09h, 0Ah, 0Bh, 0Ch, 0Dh, 0Eh, 70h,
72h, 73h, 74h, 75h, 76h, and 77h. DOS 3.2 has a special check in the
initialization code for a PCjr and don't enable stack switching on that machine.



INTERRUPTS���������������������������������������������������������������������

 Microsoft recommends that a program wishing to examine or set the contents of
any interrupt vector use the DOS function calls 35h and 25h provided for those
purposes and avoid referencing the interrupt vector locations directly.
 DOS reserves interrupt numbers 20h to 3Fh for its own use. This means absolute
memory locations 80h to 0FFh are reserved by DOS. The defined interrupts are as
follows with all values in hexadecimal.

 DOS provides a wide variety of function calls for character device I/O, file
management, memory management, date and time functions,execution of other
programs, and more. They are grouped as follows:

CALLING THE DOS SERVICES�������������������������������������������������������

 The DOS services are invoked by placing the number of the desired function in
register AH, subfunction in AL, setting the other registers to any specific
requirements of the function, and invoking int 21h.

 On return, the requested service will be performed if possible. Most codes
will return an error; some return more information. Details are contained in
the listings for the individual functions. Extended error return may be
obtained by calling function 59h (see 59h).

 Register settings listed are the ones used by DOS. Some functions will return
with garbage values in unused registers. Do not test for values in unspecified
registers; your program may exhibit odd behavior.

 DS:DX pointers are the data segment register (DS) indexed to the DH and DL
registers (DX). DX always contains the offset address, DS contains the segment
address.

 The File Control Block services (FCB services) were part of DOS 1.0. Since
the release of DOS 2.0, Microsoft has recommended that these services not be
used. A set of considerably more enhanced services (handle services) were
introduced with DOS 2.0. The handle services provide support for wildcards and
subdirectories, and enhanced error detection via function 59h.

 The data for the following calls was compiled from various Intel, Microsoft,
IBM, and other publications. There are many subtle differences between MSDOS
and PCDOS and between the individual versions. Differences between the
versions are noted as they occur.

 There are various ways of calling the DOS functions. For all methods, the
function number is loaded into register AH, subfunctions and/or parameters are
loaded into AL or other registers, and call int 21 by one of the following
methods:
 A) call interrupt 21h directly  (the recommended procedure)
 B) perform a long call to offset 50h in the program's PSP.
     1) This method will not work under DOS 1.x
     2) Though recommended by Microsoft for DOS 2.0, this method takes more
        time and is no longer recommended.
 C) place the function number in CL and perform an intrasegment call to
    location 05h in the current code segment. This location contains a long
    call to the DOS function dispatcher.
     1) IBM recommends this method be used only when using existing programs
        written for different calling conventions. (such as converting CP/M
        programs). This method should be avoided unless you have some specific
        use for it.
     2) AX is always destroyed by this method.
     3) This method is valid only for functions 00h-24h.

 There are also various ways of exiting from a program. (assuming it is not
intended to be a TSR). All methods except call 4Ch must ensure that the
segment register contains the segment address of the PSP.
 A) Interrupt 21h, function 4Ch (Terminate with Result Code). This is the
    "official" recommended method of returning to DOS.
 B) Interrupt 21h, function 00h (Exit Program). This is the early style
    int 21 function call. It simply calls int 20h.
 C) Interrupt 20h (Exit).
 D) A JMP instruction to offset 00h (int 20h vector) in the Program Segment
    Prefix. This is just a roundabout method to call int 20h. This method
    was set up in DOS 1.0 for ease of conversion for CP/M programs. It is no
    longer recommended for use.
 E) A JMP instruction to offset 05h (int 21 vector) in the Program Segment
    Prefix, with AH set to 00h or 4Ch. This is another CP/M type function.




INT 21H   DOS services
          Function (hex)

* Indicates Functions not documented in the IBM DOS Technical Reference.
 Note some functions have been documented in other Microsoft or licensed OEM
documentation.


Function  00h   Terminate Program
      Ends program, updates, FAT, flushes buffers, restores registers
entry   AH      00h
        CS      segment address of PSP
return  none
note 1) Program must place the segment address of the PSP control block in CS
        before calling this function.
     2) The terminate, ctrl-break,and critical error exit addresses (0Ah, 0Eh,
        12h) are restored to the values they had on entry to the terminating
        program, from the values saved in the program segment prefix at
        locations PSP:000Ah, PSP:000Eh, and PSP:0012h.
     3) All file buffers are flushed and the handles opened by the process are
        closed.
     4) Any files that have changed in length and are not closed are not
        recorded properly in the directory.
     5) Control transfers to the terminate address.
     6) This call performs exactly the same function as int 20h.
     7) All memory used by the program is returned to DOS.


Function  01h     Get Keyboard Input
        Waits for char at STDIN (if nescessary), echoes to STDOUT
entry   AH      01h
return  AL      ASCII character from STDIN (8 bits)
note 1) Checks char for Ctrl-C, if char is Ctrl-C, executes int 23h.
     2) For function call 06h, extended ASCII codes require two function calls.
        The first call returns 00h as an indicator that the next call will be an
        extended ASCII code.
     3) Input and output are redirectable. If redirected, there is no way to
        detect EOF.


Function  02h   Display Output
      Outputs char in DL to STDOUT
entry   AH      02h
        DL      8 bit data (usually ASCII character)
return  none
note 1) If char is 08 (backspace) the cursor is moved 1 char to the left
        (nondestructive backspace).
     2) If Ctrl-C is detected after input, int 23h is executed.
     3) Input and output are redirectable. If redirected, there is no way to
        detect disk full.


Function  03h   Auxiliary Input
      Get (or wait until) character from STDAUX
entry   AH      03h
return  AL      char from auxiliary device
note 1) AUX, COM1, COM2 is unbuffered and not interrupt driven
     2) This function call does not return status or error codes. For greater
        control it is recommended that you use ROM BIOS routine (int 14h) or
        write an AUX device driver and use IOCTL.
     3) At startup, PC-DOS initializes the first auxiliary port (COM1) to 2400
        baud, no parity, one stop bit, and an 8-bit word. MSDOS may differ.
     4) If Ctrl-C is has been entered from STDIN, int 23h is executed.


Function  04h   Auxiliary Output
      Write character to STDAUX
entry   AH      04h
        DL      char to send to AUX
return  none
note 1) This function call does not return status or error codes. For greater
        control it is recommended that you use ROM BIOS routine (int 14h) or
        write an AUX device driver and use IOCTL.
     2) If Ctrl-C is has been entered from STDIN, int 23h is executed.
     3) Default is COM1 unless redirected by DOS.
     4) If the device is busy, this function will wait until it is ready.


Function  05h   Printer Output
      Write character to STDPRN
entry   AL      05h
        DL      character to send
return  none
note 1) If Ctrl-C is has been entered from STDIN, int 23h is executed.
     2) Default is PRN or LPT1 unless redirected with the MODE command.
     3) If the printer is busy, this function will wait until it is ready.


Function  06h   Direct Console I/O
      Get character from STDIN; echo character to STDOUT
entry   AH      06h
        DL      0FFh for console input, or 00h-0FEh for console output
return  ZF      set   (1) = no character
                clear (0) = character recieved
        AL      character
note 1) Extended ASCII codes require two function calls. The first call returns
        00h to indicate the next call will return an extended code.
     2) If DL is not 0FFh, DL is assumed to have a valid character that is
        output to STDOUT.
     3) This function does not check for Ctrl-C or Ctrl-PrtSc.
     4) Does not echo input to screen
     5) If I/O is redirected, EOF or disk full cannot be detected.


Function  07h   Direct Console Input Without Echo         (does not check BREAK)
      Get or wait for char at STDIN, returns char in AL
entry   AH      07h
return  AL      character from standard input device
note 1) Extended ASCII codes require two function calls. The first call returns
        00h to indicate the next call will return an extended code.
     2) No checking for Ctrl-C or Ctrl-PrtSc is done.
     3) Input is redirectable.


Function  08h   Console Input Without Echo                (checks BREAK)
      Get or Wait for char at STDIN, return char in AL
entry   AH      08h
return  AL      char from standard input device
note 1) Char is checked for ctrl-C. If ctrl-C is detected, executes int 23h.
     2) For function call 08h, extended ASCII characters require two function
        calls. The first call returns 00h to signify an extended ASCII code.
        The next call returns the actual code.
     3) Input is redirectable. If redirected, there is no way to check EOF.


Function  09h   Print String
      Outputs Characters in the Print String to the STDOUT
entry   AH      09h
        DS:DX   pointer to the Character String to be displayed
return  none
note 1) The character string in memory must be terminated by a $ (24h)
        The $ is not displayed.
     2) Output to STDOUT is the same as function call 02h.


Function  0Ah   Buffered Keyboard Input
      Reads characters from STDIN and places them in the buffer beginning
      at the third byte.
entry   AH      0Ah
        DS:DX   pointer to an input buffer
return  none
note 1) Min buffer size = 1, max = 255
     2) Char is checked for ctrl-C. If ctrl-C is detected, executes int 23h.
     3) Format of buffer DX:
        byte       contents
         1      Maximum number of chars the buffer will take, including CR.
                Reading STDIN and filling the buffer continues until a carriage
                return (<enter> or 0Dh) is read. If the buffer fills to one less
                than the maximum number the buffer can hold, each additional
                number read is ignored and ASCII 7 (BEL) is output to the
                display until a carriage return is read. (you must set this
                value)
         2      Actual number of characters received, excluding the carriage
                return, which is always the last character. (the function sets
                this value)
         3-n    Characters received are placed into the buffer starting here.
                Buffer must be at least as long as the number in byte 1.
     4) Input is redirectable. If redirected, there is no way to check EOF.
     5) The string may be edited with the standard DOS editing commands as it
        is being entered.
     6) Extended ASCII characters are stored as 2 bytes, the first byte being
        zero.


Function  0Bh   Check Standard Input (STDIN) status
      Checks for character availible at STDIN
entry   AH      0Bh
return  AL      0FFh    if a character is availible from STDIN
                00h     if no character is availible from STDIN
note 1) Checks for Ctrl-C. If Ctrl-C is detected, int 23h is executed
     2) Input can be redirected.
     3) Checks for character only, it is not read into the application
     4) IBM reports that this call does not work properly under the DOSSHELL
        program in DOS 4.00 and 4.01. DOSSHELL will return all zeroes. This
        function works correctly from the command line or application.


Function  0Ch   Clear Keyboard Buffer &amp; Invoke a Keyboard Function       (FCB)
      Dumps buffer, executes function in AL (01h,06h,07h,08h,0Ah only)
entry   AH      0Ch
        AL      function number (must be 01h, 06h, 07h, 08h, or 0Ah)
return  AL      00h     buffer was flushed, no other processing performed
                other   any other value has no meaning
note 1) Forces system to wait until a character is typed.
     2) Flushes all typeahead input, then executes function specified by AL (by
        moving it to AH and repeating the int 21 call).
     3) If AL contains a value not in the list above, the keyboard buffer is
        flushed and no other action is taken.


Function  0Dh   Disk Reset
      Flushes all currently open file buffers to disk
entry   AH      0Dh
return          none
note 1) Does not close files. Does not update directory entries; files changed
        in size but not closed are not properly recorded in the directory
     2) Sets DTA address to DS:0080h
     3) Should be used before a disk change, Ctrl-C handlers, and to flush
        the buffers to disk.


Function  0Eh   Select Disk
      Sets the drive specified in DL (if valid) as the default drive
entry   AL      0Eh
        DL      new default drive number (0=A:,1=B:,2=C:,etc.)
return  AL      total number of logical drives (not nescessarily physical)
note 1) For DOS 1.x and 2.x, the minimum value for AL is 2.
     2) For DOS 3.x and 4.x, the minimum value for AL is 5.
     3) The drive number returned is not nescessarily a valid drive.
     4) For DOS 1.x: 16 logical drives are availible, A-P.
        For DOS 2.x: 63 logical drives are availible. (Letters are only used for
                     the first 26 drives. If more than 26 logical drives are
                     used, further drive letters will be other ASCII characters
                     ie {,], etc.
        For DOS 3.x: 26 logical drives are availible, A-Z.
        For DOS 4.x: 26 logical drives are availible, A-Z.


Function  0Fh   Open Disk File                                            (FCB)
      Searches current directory for specified filename and opens it
entry   AH      0Fh
        DS:DX   pointer to an unopened FCB
return  AL      00h     if file found
                0FFh    if file not not found
note 1) If the drive code was 0 (default drive) it is changed to the actual
        drive used (1=A:,2=B:,3=C:, etc). This allows changing the default drive
        without interfering with subsequent operations on this file.
     2) The current block field (FCB bytes C-D, offset 0Ch) is set to zero.
     3) The size of the record to be worked with (FCB bytes E-F, offset 0Eh) is
        set to the system default of 80h. The size of the file (offset 10h) and
        the date (offset 14h) are set from information obtained in the root
        directory. You can change the default value for the record size (FCB
        bytes E-F) or set the random record size and/or current record field.
        Perform these actions after the open but before any disk operations.
     4) The file is opened in compatibility mode.
     5) Microsoft recommends handle function call 3Dh be used instead.
     6) This call is also used by the APPEND command in DOS 3.2+
     7) Before performing a sequential disk operation on the file, you must
        set the Current Record field (offset 20h). Before performing a random
        disk operation on the file, you must set the Relative Record field
        (offset 21h). If the default record size of 128 bytes is incorrect, set
        it to the correct value.


Function  10h  Close File                                              (FCB)
     Closes a File After a File Write
entry   AH      10h
        DS:DX   pointer to an opened FCB
return  AL      00h     if the file is found and closed
                0FFh    if the file is not found in the current directory
note 1) This function call must be done on open files that are no longer needed,
        and after file writes to insure all directory information is updated.
     2) If the file is not found in its correct position in the current
        directory, it is assumed that the diskette was changed and AL returns
        0FFh. This error return is reportedly not completely reliable with DOS
        version 2.x.
     3) If found, the directory is updated to reflect the status in the FCB, the
        buffers to that file are flushed, and AL returns 00h.


Function  11h   Search For First Matching Entry                           (FCB)
      Searches current disk &amp; directory for first matching filename
entry   AH      11h
        DS:DX   pointer to address of FCB
return  AL      00h     successful match
                0FFh    no matching filename found
note 1) The FCB may contain the wildcard character ? under Dos 2.x, and ? or *
        under 3.x and 4.x.
     2) The original FCB at DS:DX contains information to continue the search
        with function 12h, and should not be modified.
     3) If a matching filename is found, AL returns 00h and the locations at the
        Disk Transfer Address are set as follows:
        a) If the FCB provided for searching was an extended FCB, then the first
           byte at the disk transfer address is set to 0FFh followed by 5 bytes
           of zeroes, then the attribute byte from the search FCB, then the
           drive number used (1=A, 2=B, etc) then the 32 bytes of the directory
           entry. Thus, the disk transfer address contains a valid unopened FCB
           with the same search attributes as the search FCB.
        b) If the FCB provided for searching was a standard FCB, then the first
           byte is set to the drive number used (1=A,2=b,etc), and the next 32
           bytes contain the matching directory entry. Thus, the disk transfer
           address contains a valid unopened normal FCB.
     4) If an extended FCB is used, the following search pattern is used:
        a) If the FCB attribute byte is zero, only normal file entries are
           found. Entries for volume label, subdirectories, hidden or system
           files, are not returned.
        b) If the attribute byte is set for hidden or system files, or
           subdirectory entries, it is to be considered as an inclusive search.
           All normal file entries plus all entries matching the specified
           attributes are returned. To look at all directory entries except the
           volume label, the attribute byte may be set to hidden + system +
           directory (all 3 bits on).
        c) If the attribute field is set for the volume label, it is considered
           an exclusive search, and ONLY the volume label entry is returned.
     5) This call is also used by the APPEND command in DOS 3.2+


Function  12h   Search For Next Entry Using FCB                          (FCB)
      Search for next matching filename
entry   AH      12h
        DS:DX   pointer to the unopened FCB specified from the previous Search
                First (11h) or Search Next (12h)
return  AL      00h     if matching filename found
                0FFh    if matching filename was not found
note 1) After a matching filename has been found using function call 11h,
        function 12h may be called to find the next match to an ambiguous
        request. For DOS 2.x, ?'s are allowed in the filename. For DOS 3.x
        and 4.x, global (*) filename characters are allowed.
     2) The DTA contains info from the previous Search First or Search Next.
     3) All of the FCB except for the name/extension field is used to keep
        information nescessary for continuing the search, so no disk operations
        may be performed with this FCB between a previous function 11h or 12h
        call and this one.
     4) If the file is found, an FCB is created at the DTA address and set up to
        open or delete it.


Function  13h   Delete File Via FCB                                       (FCB)
      Deletes file specified in FCB from current directory
entry   AH      13h
        DS:DX   pointer to address of FCB
return  AL      00h     file deleted
                0FFh    if file not found or was read-only
note 1) All matching current directory entries are deleted. The global filename
        character "?" is allowed in the filename.
     2) Will not delete files with read-only attribute set
     3) Close open files before deleting them.
     4) Requires Network Access Rights


Function  14h   Sequential Disk File Read                                 (FCB)
      Reads record sequentially from disk via FCB
entry   AH  14h
        DS:DX   pointer to an opened FCB
return  AL      00h     successful read
                01h     end of file (no data read)
                02h     Data Transfer Area too small for record size specified
                        or segment overflow
                03h     partial record read, EOF found
note 1) The record size is set to the value at offset 0Eh in the FCB.
     2) The record pointed to by the Current Block (offset 0Ch) and the Current
        Record (offset 20h) fields is loaded at the DTA, then the Current Block
        and Current Record fields are incremented.
     3) The record is read into memory at the current DTA address as specified
        by the most recent call to function 1Ah. If the size of the record and
        location of the DTA are such that a segment overflow or wraparound would
        occur, the error return is set to AL=02h
     4) If a partial record is read at the end of the file, it is passed to the
        requested size with zeroes and the error return is set to AL=03h.


Function  15h   Sequential Disk Write                                     (FCB)
      Writes record specified by FCB sequentially to disk
entry   AH      15h
        DS:DX   pointer to address of FCB
return  AL      00h     successful write
                01h     diskette full, write canceled
                02h     disk transfer area (DTA) too small or segment wrap
note 1) The data to write is obtained from the disk transfer area
     2) The record size is set to the value at offset 0Eh in the FCB.
     3) This service cannot write to files set as read-only
     4) The record pointed to by the Current Block (offset 0Ch) and the Current
        Record (offset 20h) fields is loaded at the DTA, then the Current Block
        and Current Record fields are incremented.
     5) If the record size is less than a sector, the data in the DTA is written
        to a buffer; the buffer is written to disk when it contains a full
        sector of data, the file is closed, or a Reset Disk (function 0Dh) is
        issued.
     6) The record is written to disk at the current DTA address as specified
        by the most recent call to function 1Ah. If the size of the record and
        location of the DTA are such that a segment overflow or wraparound would
        occur, the error return is set to AL=02h


Function  16h   Create A Disk File                                        (FCB)
      Search and open or create directory entry for file
entry   AH      16h
        DS:DX   pointer to an FCB
return  AL      00h     successful creation
                0FFh    no room in directory
note 1) If a matching directory entry is found, the file is truncated to zero
        bytes.
     2) If there is no matching filename, a filename is created.
     3) This function calls function 0Fh (Open File) after creating or
        truncating a file.
     4) A hidden file can be created by using an extended FCB with the attribute
        byte (offset FCB-1) set to 2.


Function  17h   Rename File Specified by File Control Block              (FCB)
      Renames file in current directory
entry   AH      17h
        DS:DX   pointer to an FCB (see note 4)
return  AL      00h     successfully renamed
                0FFh    file not found or filename already exists
note 1) This service cannot rename read-only files
     2) The "?" wildcard may be used.
     3) If the "?" wildcard is used in the second filename, the corresponding
        letters in the filename of the directory entry are not changed.
     4) The FCB must have a drive number, filename, and extension in the usual
        position, and a second filename starting 6 bytes after the first, at
        offset 11h.
     5) The two filenames cannot have the same name.
     6) FCB contains new name starting at byte 17h.


Function  18h  Internal to DOS
 *   Unknown
entry   AH      18h
return  AL      0


Function  19h   Get Current Disk Drive
      Return designation of current default disk drive
entry   AH      19h
return  AL      current default drive (0=A, 1=B,etc.)
note    Some other DOS functions use 0 for default, 1=A, 2=B, etc.


Function  1Ah   Set Disk Transfer Area Address (DTA)
      Sets DTA address to the address specified in DS:DX
entry   AH      1Ah
        DS:DX   pointer to buffer
return  none
note 1) The default DTA is 128 bytes at offset 80h in the PSP. DOS uses the
        DTA for all file I/O.
     2) Registers are unchanged.
     3) No error codes are returned.
     2) Disk transfers cannot wrap around from the end of the segment to the
        beginning or overflow into another segment.


Function  1Bh   Get Current Drive File Allocation Table Information
      Returns information from the FAT on the current drive
entry   AH      1Bh
exit    AL      number of sectors per allocation unit (cluster)
        DS:BX   address of the current drive's media descriptor byte
        CX      number of bytes per sector
        DX      number of allocation units (clusters) for default drive
note 1) Save DS before calling this function.
     2) This call returned a pointer to the FAT in DOS 1.x. Beginning with
        DOS 2.00, it returns a pointer only to the table's ID byte.
     3) IBM recommends programmers avoid this call and use int 25h instead.


Function  1Ch   Get File Allocation Table Information for Specific Device
      Returns information on specified drive
entry   AH      1Ch
        DL      drive number (1=A, 2=B, 3=C, etc)
return  AL      number of sectors per allocation unit (cluster)
        DS:BX   address of media descriptor byte for drive in DL
        CX      sector size in bytes
        DX      number of allocation units (clusters)
note 1) DL = 0 for default.
     2) Save DS before calling this function.
     3) Format of media-descriptor byte:
        bits:   0       0   (clear)   not double sided
                        1   (set)     double sided
                1       0   (clear)   not 8 sector
                        1   (set)     8 sector

                        1   (set)     removable device
                3-7     always set (1)
     4) This call returned a pointer to the FAT in DOS 1.x. Beginning with
        DOS 2.00, it returns a pointer only to the table's ID byte.
     5) IBM recommends programmers avoid this call and use int 25h instead.

        other registers unknown
return  AL      00h     no error
                0FFh    error
        DS:BX   points to DOS Disk Parameter Block for default drive.
note 1) Unknown vector returned in ES:BX.
     2) For DOS 2.x and 3.x, this just invokes function 32h (undocumented,
        Read DOS Disk Block) with DL=0


Function  20h  Unknown
 *   Internal - does nothing?
entry   AH      20h

Function  21h  Random Read from File Specified by File Control Block     (FCB)
     Reads one record as specified in the FCB into the current DTA.
entry   AH      21h
        DS:DX   address of the opened FCB
return  AL      00h     successful read operation
                01h     end of file (EOF), no data read
                02h     DTA too small for the record size specified
                03h     end of file (EOF), partial data read
note 1) The current block and current record fields are set to agree with the
        random record field. Then the record addressed by these fields is read
        into memory at the current Disk Transfer Address.
     2) The current file pointers are NOT incremented this function.
     3) If the DTA is larger than the file, the file is padded to the requested
        length with zeroes.


Function  22h  Random Write to File Specified by FCB                      (FCB)
     Writes one record as specified in the FCB to the current DTA
entry   AH      22h
        DS:DX   address of the opened FCB
return  AL      00h     successful write operation
                01h     disk full; no data written (write was canceled)
                02h     DTA too small for the record size specified (write was
                        canceled)
note 1) This service cannot write to read-only files.
     2) The record pointed to by the Current Block (offset 0Ch) and the Current
        Record (offset 20h) fields is loaded at the DTA, then the Current Block
        and Current Record fields are incremented.
     3) If the record size is less than a sector, the data in the DTA is written
        to a buffer; the buffer is written to disk when it contains a full
        sector of data, the file is closed, or a Reset Disk (function 0Dh) is
        issued.
     4) The current file pointers are NOT incremented this function.
     5) The record is written to disk at the current DTA address as specified
        by the most recent call to function 1Ah. If the size of the record and
        location of the DTA are such that a segment overflow or wraparound would
        occur, the error return is set to AL=02h


Function  23h  Get File Size                                             (FCB)
     Searches current subdirectory for matching file, returns size in FCB
entry   AH      23h
        DS:DX   address of an unopened FCB
return  AL      00h file found
                0FFh file not found
note 1) Record size field (offset 0Eh) must be set before invoking this function
     2) The disk directory is searched for the matching entry. If a matching
        entry is found, the random record field is set to the number of records
        in the file. If the value of the Record Size field is not an even
        divisor of the file size, the value set in the relative record field is
        rounded up. This gives a returned value larger than the actual file size
     3) This call is used by the APPEND command in DOS 3.2+


Function  24h  Set Relative Record Field                                  (FCB)
     Set random record field specified by an FCB
entry   AH      24h
        DS:DX   address of an opened FCB
return  Random Record Field of FCB is set to be same as Current Block
        and Current Record.
note 1) You must invoke this function before performing random file access.
     2) The relative record field of FCB (offset 21h) is set to be same as the
        Current Block (offset 0Ch) and Current Record (offset 20h).
     3) No error codes are returned.
     4) The FCB must already be opened.


Function  25h  Set Interrupt Vector
     Sets the address of the code DOS is to perform each time the specified
     interrupt is invoked.
entry   AH      25h
        AL      int number to reassign the handler to
        DS:DX   address of new interrupt vector
return  none
note 1) Registers are unchanged.
     2) No error codes are returned.
     3) The interrupt vector table for the interrupt number specified in AL
        is set to the address contained in DS:DX. Use function 35h (Get Vector)
        to get the contents of the interrupt vector and save it for later use.
     4) When you use function 25 to set an interrupt vector, DOS 3.2 doesn't
        point the actual interrupt vector to what you requested. Instead, it
        sets the interrupt vector to point to a routine inside DOS, which does
        this:
                1. Save old stack pointer
                2. Switch to new stack pointer allocated from DOS's stack pool
                3. Call your routine
                4. Restore old stack pointer
        The purpose for this was to avoid possible stack overflows when there
        are a large number of active interrupts. IBM was concerned (this was an
        IBM change, not Microsoft) that on a Token Ring network there would be
        a lot of interrupts going on, and applications that hadn't allocated
        very much stack space would get clobbered.


Function  26h  Create New Program Segment Prefix (PSP)
     This service copies the current program-segment prefix to a new memory
     location for the creation of a new program or overlay. Once the new PSP is
     in place, a DOS program can read a DOS COM or overlay file into the memory
     location immediately following the new PSP and pass control to it.
entry   AH      26h
        DX      segment number for the new PSP
return  none
note 1) Microsoft recommends you use the newer DOS service 4Bh (EXEC) instead.
     2) The entire 100h area at location 0 in the current PSP is copied into
        location 0 of the new PSP. The memory size information at location 6
        in the new segment is updated and the current termination, ctrl-break,
        and critical error addresses from interrupt vector table entries for
        ints 22h, 23h, and 24 are saved in the new program segment starting at
        0Ah. They are restored from this area when the program terminates.
     3) Current PSP is copied to specified segment


Function  27h  Random Block Read From File Specified by FCB
     Similar to 21h (Random Read) except allows multiple files to be read.
entry   AH      27h
        CX      number of records to be read
        DS:DX   address of an opened FCB
return  AL      00h     successful read
                01h     end of file, no data read
                02h     DTA too small for record size specified (read canceled)
                03h     end of file
        CX      actual number of records read (includes partial if AL=03h)
note 1) The record size is specified in the FCB. The service updates the Current
        Block (offset 0Ch) and Current Record (offset 20h) fields to the next
        record not read.
     2) If CX contained 0 on entry, this is a NOP.
     3) If the DTA is larger than the file, the file is padded to the requested
        length with zeroes.
     4) This function assumes that the FCB record size field (0Eh) is correctly
        set. If not set by the user, the default is 128 bytes.
     5) The record is written to disk at the current DTA address as specified
        by the most recent call to function 1Ah. If the size of the record and
        location of the DTA are such that a segment overflow or wraparound would
        occur, the error return is set to AL=02h


Function  28h  Random Block Write to File Specified in FCB
     Similar to 27h (Random Write) except allows multiple files to be read.
entry   AH      28h
        CX      number of records to write
        DS:DX   address of an opened FCB
return  AL      00h     successful write
                01h     disk full, no data written
                02h     DTA too small for record size specified (write canceled)
        CX      number of records written
note 1) The record size is specified in the FCB.
     2) This service allocates disk clusters as required.
     3) This function assumes that the FCB Record Size field (offset 0Eh) is
        correctly set. If not set by the user, the default is 128 bytes.
     4) The record size is specified in the FCB. The service updates the Current
        Block (offset 0Ch) and Current Record (offset 20h) fields to the next
        record not read.
     5) The record is written to disk at the current DTA address as specified
        by the most recent call to function 1Ah. If the size of the record and
        location of the DTA are such that a segment overflow or wraparound would
        occur, the error return is set to AL=02h
     6) If called with CX=0, no records are written, but the FCB's File Size
        entry (offset 1Ch) is set to the size specified by the FCB's Relative
        Record field (offset 21h).


Function  29h  Parse the Command Line for Filename
     Parses a text string into the fields of a File Control Block
entry   AH      29h
        DS:SI   pointer to string to parse
        ES:DI   pointer to memory buffer to fill with unopened FCB
        AL      bit mask to control parsing
                bit 0 = 0: parsing stops if file seperator found
                        1: causes service to scan past leading chars such as
                           blanks. Otherwise assumes the filename begins in
                           the first byte
                    1 = 0: drive number in FCB set to default (0) if string
                           contains no drive number

                    2 = 0: filename in FCB set to 8 blanks if no filename in
                           string
                        1: filename in FCB not changed if string does not
                           contain a filename
                    3 = 0: extension in FCB set to 3 blanks if no extension in
                           string
                        1: extension left unchanged
                    4-7    must be zero
return  AL      00h     no wildcards in name or extension
                01h     wildcards appeared in name or extension
                0FFh    invalid drive specifier
        DS:SI   pointer to the first byte after the parsed string
        ES:DI   pointer to a buffer filled with the unopened FCB
note 1) If the * wildcard characters are found in the command line, this service
        will replace all subsequent chars in the FCB with question marks.
     2) This service uses the characters as filename separators
        DOS 1       : ; . , + / [ ] = " TAB SPACE
        DOS 2,3     : ; . , + = TAB SPACE
     3) This service uses the characters
        : ; . , + &lt; &gt; | / \ [ ] = " TAB SPACE
        or any control characters as valid filename separators
     4) A filename cannot contain a filename terminator. If one is encountered,
        all processing stops. The handle functions will allow use of some of
        these characters.
     5) If no valid filename was found on the command line, ES:DI +1 points
        to a blank (ASCII 32).
     6) This function cannot be used with filespecs which include a path
     7) Parsing is in the form D:FILENAME.EXT. If one is found, a corresponding
        unopened FCB is built at ES:DI


Function  2Ah  Get Date
     Returns day of the week, year, month, and date
entry   AH      2Ah
return  CX      year    (1980-2099)

                        06h     Saturday
note 1) Date is adjusted automatically if clock rolls over to the next day,
        and takes leap years and number of days in each month into account.
     2) Although DOS cannot set an invalid date, it can read one, such as
        1/32/80, etc.
     3) DesQview also accepts CX = 4445h and DX = 5351h, i.e. 'DESQ' as valid
     4) DOS will accept CH=0 (midnight) as a valid time, but if a file's time
        is set to exactly midnight the time will not be displayed by the DIR
        command.

return  none
note 1) This is the call invoked by the DOS VERIFY command
     2) Setting of the verify switch can be obtained by calling call 54h
     3) This call is not supported on network drives
     4) DOS checks this flag each time it accesses a disk


Function  2Fh  Get Disk Transfer Address (DTA)
     Returns current disk transfer address used by all DOS read/write operations
entry   AH      2Fh
return  ES:BX   address of DTA
note 1) The DTA is set by function call 1Ah
     2) Default DTA address is a 128 byte buffer at offset 80h in that program's
        Program Segment Prefix


Function  30h  Get DOS Version Number
     Return DOS version and/or user number
entry   AH      30h
return  AH      minor version number  (i.e., DOS 2.10 returns AX = 0A02h)
        AL      major version number
        BH      OEM ID number
                00h     IBM
                16h     DEC    (others not known)
        BL:CX   24-bit user serial number
note 1) If AL returns a major version number of zero, the DOS version is
        below 1.28 for MSDOS and below 2.00 for PCDOS.
     2) IBM PC-DOS always returns 0000h in BX and CX.
     3) OS/2 v1.0 Compatibility Box returns a value of 10 for major version.
     4) Due to the OS/2 return and the fact that some European versions of DOS
        carry higher version numbers than IBM's DOS, utilities which check
        for a DOS version should not abort if a higher version than required
        is found unless some specific problems are known.


Function  31h  Terminate Process and Stay Resident
     KEEP, or TSR
entry   AH      31h

        AL      exit code
        DX      program memory requirement in 16 byte paragraphs
return  AX      return code (retrieveable by function 4Dh)
note 1) Files opened by the application are not closed when this call is made
     2) Memory can be used more efficiently if the block containing the copy of
        the DOS environment is deallocated before terminating. This can be done
        by loading ES with the segment contained in 2Ch of the PSP and issuing
        function call 49h (Free Allocated Memory).
     3) Unlike int 27h, more than 64k may be made resident with this call


Function  32h  Read DOS Disk Block

note 1) Use [BX+0D] to find no. of clusters (&gt;1000H, 16-bit FAT; if not, 12-bit
        (exact dividing line is probably a little below 1000h to allow for
        bad sectors, EOF markers, etc.)
     2) Short article by C.Petzold, PC Magazine  Vol.5,no.8, and the article
        "Finding Disk Parameters" in the May 1986 issue of PC Tech Journal.
     3) This call is mostly supported in OS/2 1.0's DOS Compatibility Box. The
        dword at 12h will not return the address of the next device driver when
        in the Compatibility Box.

Function  33h  Control-Break Check
     Get or set control-break checking at CON

Function  34h  Return INDOS Flag
 *   Returns ES:BX pointing to Critical Section Flag, byte indicating whether
     it is safe to interrupt DOS.
entry   AH      34h
return  ES:BX   points to DOS "critical section flag"
note 1) If byte is 0, it is safe to interrupt DOS. This was mentioned in some
        documentation by Microsoft on a TSR standard, and PC Magazine reports
        it functions reliably under DOS versions 2.0 through 3.3. Chris
        Dunford (of CED fame) and a number of anonymous messages on the BBSs
        indicate it may not be totally reliable.
     2) The byte at ES:BX+1 is used by the Print program for this same purpose,
        so it's probably safer to check the WORD at ES:BX.
     3) Reportedly, examination of DOS 2.10 code in this area indicates that the
        byte immediately following this "critical section flag" must be 00h to
        permit the PRINT.COM interrupt to be called. For DOS 3.0 and 3.1 (except
        Compaq DOS 3.0), the byte before the "critical section flag" must be
        zero; for Compaq DOS 3.0, the byte 01AAh before it must be zero.
     4) In DOS 3.10 this reportedly changed to word value, with preceding byte.
     5) This call is supported in OS/2 1.0's DOS Compatibility Box
     6) Gordon Letwin of Microsoft discussed this call on ARPAnet in 1984. He
        stated:
        a) this is not supported under any version of the DOS
        b) it usually works under DOS 2, but there may be circumstances
           when it doesn't (general disclaimer, don't know of a specific
           circumstance)
        c) it will usually not work under DOS 3 and DOS 3.1; the DOS is
           considerably restructured and this flag takes on additional
           meanings and uses
        d) it will fail catastrophically under DOS 4.0 and forward.
           Obviously this information is incorrect since the call works fine
           through DOS 3.3. Microsoft glasnost?


Function  35h  Get Vector
     Get interrupt vector
entry   AH      35h
        AL      interrupt number (hexadecimal)
return  ES:BX   address of interrupt vector
note    Use function call 25h to set the interrupt vectors


Function  36h  Get Disk Free Space
     get information on specified drive
entry   AH      36h
        DL      drive number (0=default, 1=A:, 2=B:, etc)
return  AX      number of sectors per cluster
                0FFFFh means drive specified in DL is invalid
        BX      number of availible clusters
        CX      bytes per sector
        DX      clusters per drive
note 1) Mult AX * CX * BX for free space on disk
     2) Mult AX * CX * DX for total disk space
     3) Function 36h returns an incorrect value after an ASSIGN command. Prior
        to ASSIGN, the DX register contains 0943h on return, which is the free
        space in clusters on the HC diskette. After ASSIGN, even with no
        parameters, 0901h is returned in the DX register; this is an incorrect
        value. Similar results occur with DD diskettes on a PC-XT or a PC-AT.
        This occurs only when the disk is not the default drive. Results are as
        expected when the drive is the default drive. Therefore, the
        circumvention is to make the desired drive the default drive prior to
        issuing this function call.
     4) Int 21h, function call 36h returns an incorrect value after an ASSIGN
        command. Prior to ASSIGN, the DX register contains 0943h on return,
        which is the free space in clusters on the HC diskette. After ASSIGN,
        even with no parameters, 0901h is returned in the DX register; this is
        an incorrect value. Similar results occur with DD diskettes on a PC-XT
        or a PC-AT. This occurs only when the disk is not the default drive.
        Results are as expected when the drive is the default drive. Therefore,
        the circumvention is to make the desired drive the default drive prior
        to issuing this function call.
     5) This function supercedes functions 1Bh and 1Ch.


Function  37h  SWITCHAR / AVAILDEV
 *   Get/set option marking character (is usually "/"), and device type
entry   AH      37h
        AL      00h     read switch character (returns current character in DL)
                01h     set character in DL as new switch character
      (DOS 2.x) 02h     read device availability (as set by function AL=3) into
                        DL. A 0 means devices that devices must be accessed in
                        file I/O calls by /dev/device. A non-zero value means
                        that devices are accessible at every level of the
                        directory tree (e.g., PRN is the printer and not a file
                        PRN).
                        AL=2 to return flag in DL, AL=3 to set from DL (0 = set,
                        1 = not set).
      (DOS 2.x) 03h     get device availability, where:
        DL      00h     means /dev/ must precede device names
                01h     means /dev/ need not precede device names
return  DL      switch character (if AL=0 or 1)
                device availability flag (if AL=2 or 3)
        AL      0FFh    the value in AL was not in the range 0-3.
note 1) Functions 2 &amp; 3 appear not to be implemented for DOS 3.x.
     2) It is documented on page 4.324 of the MS-DOS (version 2) Programmer's
        Utility Pack (Microsoft - published by Zenith).
     3) Works on all versions of IBM PC-DOS from 2.0 through 3.3.1.
     4) The SWITCHAR is the character used for "switches" in DOS command
        arguments (defaults to '/', as in "DIR/P"). '-' is popular to make a
        system look more like UNIX; if the SWITCHAR is anything other than '/',
        then '/' may be used instead of '\' for pathnames
     5) Ignored by XCOPY, PKARC, LIST
     6) SWITCHAR may not be set to any character used in a filename
     7) In DOS 3.x you can still read the "AVAILDEV" byte with subfunction 02h
        but it always returns 0FFh even if you try to change it to 0 with
        subfunction 03h.
     8) AVAILDEV=0 means that devices must be referenced in an imaginary
        subdirectory "\dev" (similar to UNIX's /dev/*); a filename "PRN.DAT"
        can be created on disk and manipulated like any other. If AVAILDEV != 0
        then device names are recognized anywhere (this is the default):
        "PRN.DAT" is synonymous with "PRN:".
     9) These functions reportedly are not supported in the same fashion in
        various implementations of DOS.

note 1) When an alternate keyboard handler is invoked, the keyboard routine is
        loaded into user memory starting at the lowest portion of availible
        user memory. The BIOS interrupt vector that services the keyboard is
        redirected to the memory area where the new routine resides. Each new
        routine takes up about 1.6K of memory and has lookup tables that return
        values unique to each language. (KEYBxx in the DOS book)
         Once the keyboard interrupt vector is changed by the DOS keyboard
        routine, the new routine services all calls unless the system is
        returned to the US format by the ctrl-alt-F1 keystroke combination. This
        does not change the interrupt vector back to the BIOS location; it
        merely passes the table lookup to the ROM locations.
     2) Ctrl-Alt-F1 will only change systems with US ROMS to the US layout.
        Some systems are delivered with non-US keyboard handler routines in ROM
     3) Case mapping call: the segment/offset of a FAR procedure that performs
        country-specific lower-to-upper case mapping on ASCII characters 80h to
        0FFh. It is called with the character to be mapped in AL. If there is
        an uppercase code for the letter, it is returned in AL, if there is no
        code or the function was called with a value of less than 80h AL is
        returned unchanged.
     4) This call is fully implemented in MS-DOS version 2.01 and higher. It
        is in version 2.00 but not fully implemented (according to Microsoft)

Function  3Ch   Create A File (CREAT)
                Create a file with handle
entry   AH      3Ch

        AX      16 bit file handle
                or error code  (3, 4, 5)
note 1) The ASCIIZ string may contain drive and subdirectory.
     2) Drive may be any valid drive (not nescessarily current drive)
     3) If the volume label or subdirectory bits are set in CX, they are ignored
     4) The file is opened in read/write mode
     5) If the file does not exist, it is created. If one of the same name
        exists, it is truncated to a length of 0.
     6) Good practice is to attempt to open a file with fn 3Dh and jump to an
        error routine if successful, create file if 3Dh fails. That way an
        existing file will not be truncated and overwritten.


Function  3Dh   Open A File
                Open disk file with handle
entry   AH      3Dh

        AX      16 bit file handle
                or error code (1, 2, 4, 5, 0Ch)
note 1) Opens any normal, system, or hidden file
     2) Files that end in a colon are not opened
     3) The rear/write pointer is set at the first byte of the file and the
        record size of the file is 1 byte (the read/write pointer can be changed
        through function call 42h). The returned file handle must be used for
        all subsequent input and output to the file.
     4) If the file handle was inherited from a parent process or was
        duplicated by DUP or FORCEDUP, all sharing and access restrictions are
        also inherited.
     5) A file sharing error (error 1) causes an int 24h to execute with an
        error code of 2


Function  3Eh   Close A File Handle
                Close a file and release handle for reuse
entry   AH      3Eh
        BX      file handle
return  flag CF 0       successful close
                1       error
        AX      error code if error (6)
note 1) When executed, the file is closed, the directory is updated, and all
        buffers for that file are flushed. If the file was changed, the time
        and date stamps are changed to current
     2) If called with the handle 00000, it will close STDIN (normally the
        keyboard).


Function  3Fh   Read From A File Or Device
                Read from file with handle
entry   AH      3Fh
        BX      file handle
        CX      number of bytes to read
        DS:DX   address of buffer
return  flag CF 0       successful read
                1       error
        AX      0       pointer was already at end of file
                        or number of bytes read
                        or error code (5, 6)
note 1) This function attempts to transfer the number of bytes specified in CX
        to a buffer location. It is not guaranteed that all bytes will be read.
        If AX &lt; CX a partial record was read.
     2) If performed from STDIN (file handle 0000), the input can be redirected
     3) If used to read the keyboard, it will only read to the first CR
     4) The file pointer is incremented to the last byte read.


Function  40h   Write To A File Or Device
                Write to file with handle
entry   AH      40h
        BX      file handle
        CX      number of bytes to write
        DS:DX   address of buffer
return  flag CF 0       successful write
                1       error
        AX      number of bytes written
                or error code  (5, 6)
note 1) This call attempts to transfer the number of bytes indicated in CX
        from a buffer to a file. If CX and AX do not match after the write,
        an error has taken place; however no error code will be returned for
        this problem. This is usually caused by a full disk.
     2) If the write is performed to STDOUT (handle 0001), it may be redirected
     3) To truncate the file at the current position of the file pointer, set
        the number of bytes in CX to zero before calling int 21h. The pointer
        can be moved to any desired position with function 42h.
     4) This function will not write to a file or device marked read-only.
     5) May also be used to display strings to CON instead of fn 09h. This
        function will write CX bytes and stop; fn 09h will continue to write
        until a $ character is found.
     6) This is the call that DOS actually uses to write to the screen in DOS
        2.x and above.

                1       error
                AX      error code (1, 6)
note 1) If pointer is at end of file, reflects file size in bytes.
     2) The value in DX:AX is the absolute 32 bit byte offset from the beginning
        of the file

return  CF      set     error
                        AX      error code (1, 2, 8, 0Ah, 0Bh)
note 1) If you make this call with AL=1 the program will be loaded as if you
        made the call with AL=0 except that the program will not be executed.
        Additionally, with AL=1 the stack segment and pointer along with the
        program's CS:IP entry point are returned to the program which made the
        4B01h call. These values are put in the four words at ES:BX+0Eh. On
        entry to the call ES:BX points to the environment address, the command
        line and the two default FCBs. This form of EXEC is used by DEBUG.COM.
     2) Application programs may invoke a secondary copy of the command
        processor (normally COMMAND.COM) by using the EXEC function.  Your
        program may pass a DOS command as a parameter that the secondary
        command processor will execute as though it had been entered from the
        standard input device.
        The procedure is:
         A. Assure that adequate free memory (17k for 2.x and 3.0, 23k for 3.1
            up) exists to contain the second copy of the command processor and
            the command it is to execute. This is accomplished by executing
            function call 4Ah to shrink memory allocated to that of your current
            requirements. Next, execute function call 48h with BX=0FFFFh. This
            returns the amount of memory availible.
        B. Build a parameter string for the secondary command processor in the
           form:
                         1 byte   length of parameter string
                        xx bytes  parameter string
                         1 byte   0Dh (carriage return)
           For example, the assembly language statement below would build the
           string to cause execution of the command FOO.EXE:
                              DB 19,"/C C:FOO",13
        C. Use the EXEC function call (4Bh), function value 0 to cause execution
           of the secondary copy of the command processor. (The drive,
           directory, and name of the command processor can be gotten from the
           COMSPEC variable in the DOS environment passed to you at PSP+2Ch.)
        D. Remember to set offset 2 of the EXEC control block to point to the
           string built above.
     3) All open files of a process are duplicated in the newly created
        process after an EXEC, except for files originally opened with the
        inheritance bit set to 1.
     4) The environment is a copy of the original command processor's
        environment. Changes to the EXECed environment are not passed back to
        the original. The environment is followed by a copy of the DS:DX
        filename passed to the child process. A zero value will cause the
        child process to inherit the environment of the calling process. The
        segment address of the environment is placed at offset 2Ch of the
        PSP of the program being invoked.
     5) This function uses the same resident part of COMMAND.COM, but makes a
        duplicate of the transient part.
     6) How EXEC knows where to return to: Basically the vector for int 22h
        holds the terminate address for the current process. When a process
        gets started, the previous contents of int 22h get tucked away in the
        PSP for that process, then int 22h gets modified. So if Process A
        EXECs process B, while Process B is running, the vector for int 22h
        holds the address to return to in Process A, while the save location in
        Process B's PSP holds the address that process A will return to when
        *it* terminates. When Process B terminates by one of the usual legal
        means, the contents of int 22h are (surmising) shoved onto the stack,
        the old terminate vector contents are copied back to int 22h vector from
        Process B's PSP, then a RETF or equivalent is executed to return control
        to process A.
     7) To load an overlay file with 4B: first, don't de-allocate the memory
        that the overlay will load into. With the other 4Bh functions, the
        opposite is true--you have to free the memory first, with function 4Ah.
        Second, the "segment address where the file will be loaded" (first item
        in the parameter block for sub-function 03) should be a paragraph
        boundary within your currently-allocated memory. Third, if the
        procedures within the overlay are FAR procs (while they execute, CS will
        be equal to the segment address of the overlay area), the relocation
        factor should be set to zero. On the other hand, if the CS register
        will be different from the overlay area's segment address, the
        relocation factor should be set to represent the difference. You
        determine where in memory the overlay file will load by using the
        segment address mentioned above. Overlay files are .EXEs (containing
        header, relocation table, and memory image).
     8) When function 00h returns, all registers are changed, including the
        stack. You must resore SS, SP, and any other required registers.


Function  4Ch   Terminate a Process (EXIT)
                Quit with ERRORLEVEL exit code
entry   AH      4Ch
        AL      exit code in AL when called, if any, is passed to next process
return  none
note 1) Control passes to DOS or calling program
     2) return code from AL can be retrieved by ERRORLEVEL or function 4Dh
     3) all files opened by this process are closed, buffers are flushed, and
        the disk directory is updated
     4) Restores Terminate vector from PSP:000Ah

note 1) Will not find volume label
     2) This function does not support network operations
     3) Wildcards are allowed in the filespec
     4) If the attribute is zero, only ordinary files are found. If the volume
        label bit is set, only volume labels will be found. Any other attribute
        will return that attribute and all normal files together.
     5) To look for everything except the volume label, set the hidden, system,
        and subdirectory bits all to 1


Function  4Fh   Find Next Matching File (FIND NEXT)
                Find next ASCIIZ file
entry   AH      4Fh
return  CF      clear   data block written at current DTA
                set     AX      error code (2, 12h)
note 1) If file found, DTA is formatted as in call 4Eh
     2) Volume label searches using 4Eh/4Fh reportedly aren't 100% reliable
        under DOS 2.x. The calls sometime report there's a volume label and
        point to a garbage DTA, and if the volume label is the only item they
        often won't find it
     3) This function does not support network operations
     4) Use of this call assumes that the original filespec contained wildcards


Function  50h   "Used Internally by DOS" - Set PSP
 *              Set new Program Segment Prefix (current Process ID)
entry   AH      50h
        BX      segment address of new PSP
return  none - swaps PSP's regarded as current by DOS
note 1) By putting the PSP segment value into BX and issuing call 50h DOS stores
        that value into a variable and uses that value whenever a file call is
        made.
     2) Note that in the PSP (or PDB) is a table of 20 (decimal) open file
        handles. The table starts at offset 18h into the PSP. If there is an
        0FFh in a byte then that handle is not in use. A number in one of the
        bytes is an index into an internal FB table for that handle. For
        instance the byte at offset 18h is for handle 0, at offset 19h handle
        1, etc. up to 13h. If the high bit is set then the file associated by
        the handle is not shared by child processes EXEC'd with call 4Bh.
     3) Function 50h is dangerous in background operations prior to DOS 3.x as
        it uses the wrong stack for saving registers.  (same as functions
        0..0Ch in DOS 2.x)
     4) Under DOS 2.x, this function cannot be invoked inside an int 28h handler
        without setting the Critical Error flag
     5) Open File information, etc. is stored in the PSP DOS views as current.
        If a program (eg. a resident program) creates a need for a second PSP,
        then the second PSP should be set as current to make sure DOS closes
        that as opposed to the first when the second application finishes.
     6) See PC Mag Vol.5, No 9, p.314 for discussion.

        changes so much, I feel it should be put in the "interesting, but
        not real useful" category.  If you depend on this stuff in production
        code, you're going to regret it.

Function  55h   "Used Internally by DOS" - Create "Child" PSP
 *              Create PSP: similar to function 26h (which creates a new Program
                Segment Prefix at segment in DX) except creates a "child" PSP
                rather than copying the existing one.
entry   AH      55h
        DX      segment number at which to create new PSP.
return  unknown
note 1) This call is similar to call 26h which creates a PSP except that unlike
        call 26h the segment address of the parent process is obtained from the
        current process ID rather than from the CS value on the stack (from the
        INT 21h call). DX has the new PSP value and SI contains the value to be
        placed into PSP:2 (top of memory).
     2) Function 55 is merely a substitute for function 26h. It will copy the
        current PSP to the segment address DX with the addition that SI is
        assumed to hold the new memory top segment. This means that function
        26h sets SI to the segment found in the current PSP and then calls
        function 55h.

                set     AX      error code (2, 3, 5, 11h)
note 1) Works with files in same drive only
     2) Global characters not allowed in filename
     3) The name of a file is its full pathname. The file's full pathname can
        be changed, while leaving the actual FILENAME.EXT unchanged. Changing
        the pathname allows the file to be "moved" from subdirectory to
        subdirectory on a logical drive without actually copying the file.
     4) DOS 3.x allows renaming of directories

                          Interrupts 22h Through 86h

note: the registered version of this chapter is more than twice this size.


Interrupt 22h   Terminate Address
(0:0088h)
 This interrupt transfers control to the far (dword) address at this interrupt
location when an application program terminates. The default address for this
interrupt is 0:0088h through 0:008Bh. This address is copied into the program's
Program Segment Prefix at bytes 0Ah through 0Dh at the time the segment is
created and is restored from the PSP when the program terminates. The calling
program is normally COMMAND.COM or an application. Do not issue this interrupt
directly, as the EXEC function call does this for you. If an application
spawns a child process, it must set the Terminate Address prior to issuing the
EXEC function call, otherwise when the second program terminated it would
return to the calling program's Terminate Address rather than its own. This
address may be set with int 21, function 25h.


Interrupt 23h   Ctrl-Break Exit Address
(0:008Ch)
 If the user enters a Ctrl-Break during STDIN, STDOUT, STDPRN, or STDAUX, int
23h is executed. If BREAK is on, int 23h is checked on MOST function calls
(notably 06h). If the user written Ctrl-Break routine saves all registers, it
may end with a return-from-interrupt instruction (IRET) to continue program
execution. If the user-written interrupt program returns with a long return, the
carry flag is used to determine whether the program will be aborted. If the
carry flag is set, the program is aborted, otherwise execution continues (as
with a return by IRET). If the user-written Ctrl-Break interrupt uses function
calls 09h or 0Ah, (Display String or Buffered Keyboard Input) then a three-byte
string of 03h-0Dh-0Ah (ETX/CR/LF) is sent to STDOUT. If execution is continued
with an IRET, I/O continues from the start of the line. When the interrupt
occurs, all registers are set to the value they had when the original function
call to DOS was made. There are no restrictions on what the Ctrl-Break handler
is allowed to do, including DOS function calls, as long as the registers are
unchanged if an IRET is used. If the program creates a new segment and loads a
second program which itself changes the Ctrl-Break address, the termination of
the second program and return to the first causes the Ctrl-Break address to
be restored from the PSP to the value it had before execution of the second
program.


Interrupt 24h   Critical Error Handler
(0:0090h)

 When a critical error occurs within DOS, control is transferred to an error
handler with an int 24h. This may be the standard DOS error handler (ABORT,
RETRY, IGNORE) or a user-written routine.
 On entry to the error handler, AH will have its bit 7=0 (high order bit)
if the error was a disk error (probably the most common error), bit 7=1 if
not.
 BP:SI contains the address of a Device Header Control Block from which
additional information can be retrieved (see below).
 The register is set up for a retry operation and an error code is in the
lower half of the DI register with the upper half undefined. These are the
error codes:

 The user stack is in effect and contains the following from top to bottom:

        IP      DOS registers from issuing int 24h
        CS      int 24h
        flags
        AX      user registers at time of signal
        BX      int 21h request
        CX
        DX
        SI
        DI
        BP
        DS
        ES
        IP      from original int 21h
        CS
        flags

 To reroute the critical error handler to a user-writen critical error handler,
the following should be done:

Before an int 24h occurs:
1) The user application initialization code should save the int 24h vector and
   replace the vector with one pointing to the user error routine.

When the int 24h occurs:
2) When the user error routine received control it should push the flag
   registers onto the stack and execute a far call to the original int 24h
   vector saved in step 1.
3) DOS gives the appropriate prompt, and waits for user input (Abort, Retry,
   Ignore, Fail). After the user input, DOS returns control to the user error
   routine instruction following the far call.
4) The user error routine can now do any tasks nescessary. To return to the
   original application at the point the error occurred, the error routine needs
   to execute an IRET instruction. Otherwise, the user error routine should
   remove the IP, CS, and flag registers from the stack. Control can then be
   passed to the desired point.

 Int 24h provides the following values in registers on entry to the interrupt
handler:

entry   AH      status byte (bits)
                7       0       disk I/O hard error
                        1       other error - if block device, bad FAT
                                - if char device, code in DI
                6       unused
                5       0       if IGNORE is not allowed
                        1       if IGNORE is allowed
                4       0       if RETRY  is not allowed
                        1       if RETRY  is allowed
                3       0       if FAIL   is not allowed
                        1       if FAIL   is allowed
                2 \     disk area of error  00 = DOS area  01 = FAT
                1 /                         10 = root dir  11 = data area
                0       0       if read operation
                        1       if write operation
        AL      drive number if AH bit 7 = 1, otherwise undefined
                If it is as hard error on disk (AH bit 7=0), register AL
                contains the failing drive number (0=A:, 1=B:, etc.).

                11h     (DOS 3.x) sharing buffer overflow

The handler must return this information:

 The registers are set such that if an IRET is executed, DOS responds according
to (AL) as follows:
 AL     00h  ignore the error
        01h  retry the operation
        02h  terminate via int 22h
        03h  fail the system call that is in progress (DOS 3.x+)
note 1) Be careful when choosing to ignore a response because this causes DOS to
        beleive that an operation has completed successfully when it may not
        have.
     2) If the error was a character device, the contents of AL are invalid.



OTHER ERRORS

 If AH bit 7=1, the error occurred on a character device, or was the result of
a bad memory image of the FAT. The device header passed in BP:SI can be examined
to determine which case exists. If the attribute byte high-order bit indicates
a block device, then the error was a bad FAT. Otherwise, the error is on a
character device.
 If a character device is involved, the contents of AL are unpredictable, the
error code is in DI as above.

Notes:
1.  Before giving this routine control for disk errors, DOS performs several
    retries. The number of retries varies according to the DOS version.
2.  For disk errors, this exit is taken only for errors occurring during an
    int 21h function call. It is not used for errors during an int 25h or 26h.
3.  This routine is entered in a disabled state.
4.  All registers must be preserved.
5.  This interrupt handler should refrain from using DOS function calls. If
    necessary, it may use calls 01h through 12h. Use of any other call destroys
    the DOS stack and leaves DOS in an unpredictable state.
6.  The interrupt handler must not change the contents of the device header.
7.  If the interrupt handler handles errors itself rather than returning to DOS,
    it should restore the application program's registers from the stack,
    remove all but the last three words on the stack, then issue an IRET. This
    will return to the program immediately after the int 21h that experienced
    the error. Note that if this is done DOS will be in an unstable state until
    a function call higher than 12h is issued, therefore not recommended.
8.  For DOS 3.x, IGNORE requests (AL=0) are converted to FAIL for critical
    errors that occur on FAT or DIR sectors.
9.  For DOS 3.10 up, IGNORE requests (AL=0) are converted to FAIL requests
    for network critical errors (50-79).

The device header pointed to by BP:SI is as follows:

DWORD Pointer to next device (0FFFFh if last device)

WORD Attributes:

Bit     15      1       if character device.
                        If bit 15 is 1:
                        Bit 0 = 1 if current standard input
                        Bit 1 = 1 if current standard output
                        Bit 2 = 1 if current NULL device
                        Bit 3 = 1 if current CLOCK device
                0       if block device
Bit 14 is the IOCTL bit
WORD pointer to device driver strategy entry point
WORD pointer to device driver interrupt entry point
8-BYTE character device named field for block devices. The first byte is the
number of units.
 To tell if the error occurred on a block or character device, look at bit 15
in the attribute field (WORD at BP:SI+4).
 If the name of the character device is desired, look at the eight bytes
starting at BP:SI+10.


HANDLING OF INVALID RESPONSES (DOS 3.x)

        A) If IGNORE (AL=0) is specified by the user and IGNORE is not allowed
           (bit 5=0), make the response FAIL (AL=3).
        B) If RETRY (AL=1) is specified by the user and RETRY is not allowed
           (bit 4=0), make the response FAIL (AL=3).
        C) If FAIL (AL=3) is specified by the user and FAIL is not allowed (bit
           3=0), make the response ABORT. (AL=2)





Interrupt 25h   Absolute Disk Read
Interrupt 26h   Absolute Disk Write
(0:0094h, 0:0098h)
  These transfer control directly to the device driver. On return, the original
flags are still on the stack (put there by the INT instruction). This is
necessary because return information is passed back in the current flags.
  The number of sectors specified is transferred between the given drive and the
transfer address. Logical sector numbers are obtained by numbering each sector
sequentially starting from track 0, head 0, sector 1 (logical sector 0) and
continuing along the same head, then to the next head until the last sector on
the last head of the track is counted.  Thus, logical sector 1 is track 0, head
0, sector 2; logical sector 2 is track 0, head 0, sector 3; and so on. Numbering
then continues wih sector 1 on head 0 of the next track. Note that although the
sectors are sequentially numbered (for example, sectors 2 and 3 on track 0 in
the example above), they may not be physically adjacent on disk, due to
interleaving. Note that the mapping is different from that used by DOS 1.10 for
dual-sided diskettes.

The request is as follows:

int 25 for Absolute Disk Read,
int 26 for Absolute Disk Write
entry   AL      drive number (0=A:, 1=B:, etc)
        CX      number of sectors to read

Interrupt 27h   Terminate And Stay Resident
(0:009Ch)       (obsolete)
 This vector is used by programs that are to remain resident when COMMAND.COM
regains control.
 After initializing itself, the program must set DX to its last address plus
one relative to the program's initial DS or ES value (the offset at which other
programs can be loaded), then execute interrupt 27h. DOS then considers the
program as an extension of itself, so the program is not overlaid when other
programs are executed. This is useful for loading programs such as utilities
and interrupt handlers that must remain resident.

entry   CS      current program segment
        DX      last program byte + 1
return  none
note 1) This interrupt must not be used by .EXE programs that are loaded into
        the high end of memory.
     2) This interrupt restores the interrupt 22h, 23h, and 24h vectors in the
        same manner as interrupt 20h.  Therefore, it cannot be used to install
        permanently resident Ctrl-Break or critical error handler routines.
     3) The maximum size of memory that can be made resident by this method is
        64K.
     4) Memory can be more efficiently used if the block containing a copy of
        the environment is deallocated before terminating. This can be done by
        loading ES with the segment contained in 2Ch of the PSP, and issuing
        function call 49h (Free Allocated Memory).
     5) DOS function call 4Ch allows a program to pass a completion code to DOS,
        which can be interpreted with processing (see function call 31h).
     6) Terminate and stay resident programs do not close files.
     7) Int 21, function 31h is the preferred method to cause a program to
        remain resident because this allows return information to be passed and
        allows a program larger than 64K to remain resident.




Interrupt 28h   (not documented by Microsoft)
           *    DOS Idle Interrupt
Int 28h has been provided by DOS since release 2.0. The int 28h process is
similar to the "Timer Tick" process provided by BIOS via int 1Ch in that it is
an "outbound" (from DOS) call which an application can "hook onto" to get
service at a particular entry point. DOS normally only issues int 28h when it
recieves a function call (int 21h) from a foreground application with an
argument in the range of 0 thru 12 (0Ch) in the AH register, or when it is
idling waiting for keyboard input. In effect, when DOS issues int 28h, it is
saying to the background task "I'm not doing anything hot right now, if you can
use the time, go ahead." This means that a foreground application which doesn't
do many low-number DOS functions can preempt CPU time easily.

 It is possible, if you are careful, to enhance the background priority by
providing more int 28h calls than DOS normally would issue.

 When int 28h is being issued it is usually safe to do DOS calls. You won't get
int 28hs if a program is running that doesn't do its keyboard input through
DOS. You should rely on the timer interrupt for these.

 It is used primarily by the PRINT.COM routines, but any number of other
routines can be chained to it by saving the original vector and calling it with
a FAR call (or just JMPing to it) at the end of the new routine.

 Int 28h is not called at all when any non-trivial foreground task is running.
As soon as a foreground program has a file open, int 28h no longer gets called.
Could make a good driver for for a background program that works as long as
there is nothing else going on in the machine.

 DOS uses 3 separate internal stacks: one for calls 01h through 0Ch; another
for calls 0Dh and above; and a third for calls 01h through 0Ch when a Critical
Error is in progress. When int 28h is called, any calls above 0Ch can be
executed without destroying the internal stack used by DOS at the time.

 The byte which is pushed on the stack before an int 28h just indicates which
stack area is being used by the current int 21h call. In DOS 3.1, the code
sequence that calls int 28h looks like this:

        PUSH    SS:[0304]
        INT     28
        POP     SS:[0304]

 The low-order byte of the word pushed contains 1 if the int 21h call currently
in progress is for services 1 through 0Ch, and 0 for service 0 and for 0Dh and
up. Assuming that the last DOS call was not a reentrant one, this tells you
which set of DOS services should be safe to call.

 If the InDOS flag is zero on int 28h, then it was called by someone other than
DOS, and the word on the stack should NOT be examined.


entry   no parameters availible
return  none
note 1) The int 28h handler may invoke any int 21h function except functions
        00h through 0Ch (and 50h/51h under DOS 2.x unless DOS CritErr flag is
        set).
     2) Apparently int 28h is also called during screen writes
     3) Until some program installs its own routine, this interrupt vector
        simply points to an IRET opcode.
     4) Supported in OS/2 1.0's DOS Compatibility Box




Interrupt 29h   (not documented by Microsoft)

     3) Works on the IBM PC and compatibles, Wang PC, HP-150 and Vectra, DEC
        Rainbow, NEC APC, Texas Instruments PC and others
     4) This interrupt is called from the DOS's output routines if output is
        going to a device rather than a file, and the device driver's attribute
        word has bit 3 (04h) set to "1".
     5) This call has been tested with MSDOS 2.11, PCDOS 2.1, PCDOS 3.1, PCDOS
        3.2, and PCDOS 3.3.
     6) Used in IBMBIO.COM as a vector to int 10, function 0Eh (write TTY)
        followed by an IRET.

Interrupt 2Bh   (not documented by Microsoft)
           *    Unknown - Internal Routine for DOS (IRET)

           *    Unknown - Internal Routine for DOS (IRET)

Interrupt 2Eh   (undocumented by Microsoft)  (DOS 2.0+)
           *    Internal Routine for DOS  (Alternate EXEC)

  This interrupt passes a command line addressed by DS:SI to COMMAND.COM. The
command line must be formatted just like the unformatted parameter area of a
Program Segment Prefix. That is, the first byte must be a count of characters,
and the second and subsequent bytes must be a command line with parameters,
terminated by a carriage return character.
  When executed, int 2Eh will reload the transient part of the command
interpreter if it is not currently in memory. If called from a program that
was called from a batch file, it will abort the batch file. If executed from a
program which has been spawned by the EXEC function, it will abort the whole
chain and probably lock up the computer. Int 2Eh also destroys all registers
including the stack pointer.
  Int 2Eh is called from the transient portion of the program to reset the DOS
PSP pointers using the above Functions #81 &amp; #80, and then reenters the
resident program.
  When called with a valid command line, the command will be carried out by
COMMAND.COM just as though you had typed it in at the DOS prompt. Note that the
count does not include the carriage return. This is an elegant way to perform a
SET from an application program against the master environment block for
example.

entry   DS:SI   pointer to an ASCIIZ command line in the form:
                        count byte

                        carriage return
                        null byte
note 1) Destroys all registers including stack pointer
     2) Seems to work OK in both DOS 2.x and 3.x
     3) It is reportedly not used by DOS.
     4) As far as known, int 2Eh is not used by DOS 3.1, although it was called
        by COMMAND.COM of PCDOS 3.0, so it appears to be in 3.1 only for the
        sake of compatibility.

Interrupt 2Fh   Multiplex Interrupt

 Interrupt 2Fh is the multiplex interrupt. A general interface is defined
between two processes. It is up to the specific application using interrupt
2Fh to define specific functions and parameters.
 This interrupt is becoming more commonly used as the availible interrupt 21
functions are getting to be in short supply.  Int 2Fh doesn't require any
support from DOS itself for it to be used in application programs. It's not
handled by DOS, but by the programs themselves.
 Every multiplex interrupt handler is assigned a specific multiplex number.
The multiplex number is specified in the AH register; the AH value tells which
program your request is directed toward. The specific function that the handler
is to perform is placed in the AL register. Other parameters are places in the
other registers as needed. The handlers are chained into the 2Fh interrupt
vector and the multiplex number is checked to see if any other application is
using the same multiplex number. There is no predefined method for assigning a
multiplex number to a handler. You must just pick one. To avoid a conflict if
two applications choose the same multiplex number, the multiplex numbers used by
an application should be patchable. In order to check for a previous
installation of the current application, you can search memory for a unique
string included in your program. If the value you wanted in AH is taken but
you don't find the string, then another application has grabbed that location.
 Int 2Fh was not documented under DOS 2.x. There is no reason not to use int 2Fh
as the multiplex interrupt in DOS 2.x. The only problem is that DOS 2.x does not
initialize the int 2Fh vector, so when you try to chain to it like you are
supposed to, it will crash. If your program checks the vector for being zero
and initializes it itself or doesn't chain in that case, it will work for you
n 2.x just the same as 3.x.

Function   01h  PRINT.COM
           Register AH identifies which program is to handle the interrupt.
           Values 00h-7Fh are reserved for DOS, not that anyone cares much.
           Values 0C0h-0FFh are reserved for applications.
           Register AL contains the function code if used
entry   AH      01h
                AL      00h     PRINT  Get Installed State
                        This call must be defined by all int 2Fh handlers. It
                        is used by the caller of the handler to determine if
                        the handler is present. On entry, AL=0. On return, AL
                        contains the installed state as follows:
                return  AL      0FFh    installed

note 1) The multiplex numbers AH=0h through AH=7Fh are reserved for DOS.
        Applications should use multiplex numbers 80h through 0FFh.
     2) When in the chain for int 2Fh, if your code calls DOS or if you execute
        with interrupts enabled, your code must be reentrant/recursive.
     3) Important! In versions of DOS prior to 3.0, the int 2Fh vector was
        initialized to zero rather than being pointed into the DOS service area.
        You must initialize this vector manually under DOS 2.x.

Interrupt 48h   Cordless Keyboard Translation (PCjr, XT [never delivered])
(0:0120h)       This vector points to code to translate the cordless keyboard
                scancodes into normal 83-key values. The translated scancodes
                are then passed to int 9. (not initialized on PC or AT)


Interrupt 49h   Non-keyboard Scan Code Translation Table Address (PCjr)
(0:0124h)       This interrupt is used for operation of non-keyboard devices
                on the PCjr, such as the Keystronic Numeric Keypad.
                This interrupt has the address of a table used to translate
                non-keyboard scancodes (greater than 85 excepting 255). This
                interrupt can be revectored by a user application. IBM
                recommends that the default table be stored at the beginning
                of an application that required revectoring this interrupt,
                and that the default table be restored when the application
                terminates. (not initialized on PC or AT)

                The PCjr BIOS can interpret scancodes other than those
                generated by the keyboard to allow for expansion. The keyboard
                generates scancodes from 01h to 055h, including 0FFh. Any
                scancodes above 55h (56h through 7Eh for make codes and 0D6h
                through 0FEh for break codes) are processed in the following
                manner:
                1) if the incoming make code falls within the range of the
                   translate table whose address is pointed to by int 49h, it
                   is translated into the corresponding scancode. Any incoming
                   break codes above 0D5h are ignored.
                2) if the new translated scancode ius less and 56h, it is
                   processed by the BIOS as a keyboard scancode and the same
                   data is placed in the BIOS keyboard buffer.
                3) if the translated scancode is higher than 55h or the
                   incoming scancode is outside the range of the translate
                   table, 40h is added creating a new extended scancode. The
                   extended scancode is placed in the BIOS keyboard buffer with
                   the character code of 00h (NUL). This utilitizes the range
                   of 96h through 0BEh for scancodes 56h through 7Eh.

                The default translate-table maps scancodes 56h through 6Ah to
                existing keyboard values. Codes 6Bh theough 0BEh are mapped (by
                adding 40h) to extended codes 0ABh through 0FEh since they are
                outside the range of the default translate table.

                The format of the translate table is:
                0       length - the number of nonkeyboard scancodes that are
                        mapped within the table (from 1 to n)
                1 to n  word  high byte 00h (NUL) byte scancode with low order
                        byte representing the scancode mapped values relative
                        to their input values within the range of 56h through
                        7Eh

                With this layout, all keyboard scancodes can be intercepted
                through int 9h and and nonkeyboard scancodes can be intercepted
                through int 48h.

                       DOS CONTROL BLOCKS AND WORK AREAS


 Contrary to popular belief, DOS is not limited to 640k of work space. This 
constraint is enforced by the mapping of ROM and video RAM into the default 1 
megabyte CPU address space. Some MSDOS compatible machines, such as the Sanyo 
55x series, can have as much as 768k of contiguous DOS workspace with the 
appropriate option boards. Since DOS has no real memory management, it cannot 
deal with a fragmented workspace. Fragmented RAM (such as RAM mapped into the 
option ROM address space) can be dealt with as a RAMdisk or other storage area 
by using a device driver or other software.

 The 80386 CPU and appropriate control software can create a DOS workspace of 
more than one megabyte. Certain add-on boards can also add more than a 
megabyte of workspace, but only for specially written software. Since these 
are all proprietary schemes, little information is availible at present.

 When DOS loads a program, it first sets aside a section of memory for the 
program called the program segment, or code segment. Then it constructs a 
control block called the program segment prefix, or PSP, in the first 256 
(100h) bytes. Usually, the program is loaded directly after the PSP at 100h.
 The PSP contains various information used by DOS to help run the program.  
The PSP is always located at offset 0 within the code segment. When a program 
recieves control certain registers are set to point to the PSP. For a COM 
file, all registers are set to point to the beginning of the PSP and the 
program begins at 100h. For the more complex EXE file structures, only DS and 
ES registers are set to point to the PSP. The linker passes the settings for 
the DS, IP, SS, and SP registers and may set the starting location in CS:IP to 
a location other than 100h.

 IBMBIO provides an IRET instruction at absolute address 847h for use as a 
dummy routine for interrupts that are not used by DOS. This lets the interrupts
do nothing until their vectors are rerouted to their appropriate handlers.

 A storage block is used by DOS to record the amount and location of allocated 
memory within the machine's address space.
 A storage block, a Program Segment Prefix, and an environment area are built 
by DOS for each program currently resident in the address space. The storage 
block is used by DOS to record the address range of memory allocated to a 
program. It is used by DOS to find the next availible area to load a program 
and to determine if there is enough memory to run that porogram. When a 
memory area is in use, it is said to be allocated. Then the program ends, or 
releases memory, it is said to be deallocated. 
 A storage block contains a pointer to the Program Segment Prefix associated 
with each program. This control block is constructed by IBMDOS for the purpose 
of providing standardized areas for DOS/program communication. Within the 
PSP are areas which  are used to save interrupt vectors, pass parameters to 
the program, record disk directory information, and to buffer disk reads and 
writes. This control block is 100h bytes in length and is followed by the 
program module loaded by DOS. 
 The PSP contains a pointer to the environment area for that program. This 
area contains a copy of the current DOS SET, PROMPT, COMSPEC, and PATH values 
as well as any user-set variables. The program may examine and modify this 
information as desired. 
 Each storage block is 10h bytes long, although only 5 bytes are currently 
used by DOS. The first byte contains 4Dh (a capital M) to indicate that it 
contains a pointer to the next storage block. A 5Ah (a capital Z) in the 
first byte of a storage block indicatres there are no more storage blocks 
following this one (it is the end of the chain). The identifier byte is 
followed by a 2 byte segment number for the associated PSP for that program. 
The next 2 bytes contain the number of segments what are allocated to the 
program. If this is not the last storage block, then another storage block 
follows the allocated memory area.
 When the storage block contains zero for the number of allocated segments, 
then no storage is allocated to this block and the next storage block 
immediately follows this one. This can happen when memory is allocated and 
then deallocated repeatedly.
 IBMDOS constructs a storage block and PSP before loading the command 
interpreter (default is COMMAND.COM).

 If the copy of COMMAND.COM is a secondary copy, it will lack an environment 
address at PSP+2Ch.
 


THE DISK TRANSFER AREA (DTA)���������������������������������������������������

 DOS uses an area in memory to contain the data for all file reads and writes 
that are performed with FCB function calls. This are is known as the disk 
transfer area. This disk transfer area (DTA) is sometimes called a buffer. 
It can be located anywhere in the data area of your application program and 
should be set by your program.

 Only one DTA can be in effect at a time, so your program must tell DOS what 
memory location to use before using any disk read or write functions. Use 
function call 1Ah (Set Disk Transfer Address) to set the disk transfer address.
Use function call 2Fh (Get Disk Transfer Address) to get the disk transfer 
address. Once set, DOS continues to use that area for all disk operations until
another function call 1Ah is issued to define a new DTA. When a program is given
control by COMMAND.COM, a default DTA large enough to hold 128 bytes is 
established at 80h into the program's Program Segment Prefix.

 For file reads and writes that are performed with the extended function calls,
there is no need to set a DTA address. Instead, specify a buffer address when 
you issue the read or write call.


DOS PROGRAM SEGMENT������������������������������������������������������������

 When you enter an external command or call a program through the EXEC function 
call, DOS determines the lowest availible address space to use as the start of 
available memory for the program being started. This area is called the Program
Segment.
 At offset 0 within the program segment, DOS builds the Program Segment Prefix 
control block. EXEC loads the program after the Program Segment Prefix (at
offset 100h) and gives it control.
 The program returns from EXEC by a jump to offset 0 in the Program Segment 
Prefix, by issuing an int 20h, or by issuing an int 21h with register AH=00h or 
4Ch, or by calling location 50h in the PSP with AH=00h or 4Ch.
 It is the responsibility of all programs to ensure that the CS register 
contains the segment address of the Program Segment Prefix when terminating by
any of these methods except call 4Ch.

 All of these methods result in returning to the program that issued the EXEC. 
During this returning process, interrupt vectors 22h, 23h, and 24h (Terminate, 
Ctrl-Break, and Critical Error Exit addresses) are restored from the values 
saved in the PSP of the terminating program. Control is then given to the 
terminate address.


When a program receives control, the following conditions are in effect:

For all programs:

1) The segment address of the passed environment is contained at offset 2Ch in 
   the Program Segment Prefix.

2) The environment is a series of ASCII strings totalling less than 32k bytes
   in the form:       NAME=value      The default environment is 160 bytes.
    Each string is a maximum of 127 bytes terminated by a byte of zeroes for a 
   total of 128 bytes, and the entire set of strings is terminated by another
   byte of zeroes. Following the byte of zeroes that terminates the set of
   environment string is a set of initial arguments passed to a program that
   contains a word count followed by an ASCIIZ string. The ASCIIZ string
   contains the drive, path, and filename.ext of the executable program.
   Programs may use this area to determine where the program was loaded from.
   The environment built by the command processor (and passed to all programs
   it invokes) contains a COMSPEC=string at a minimum (the parameter on COMSPEC
   is the path used by DOS to locate COMMAND.COM on disk). The last PATH and
   PROMPT commands issued will also be in the environment, along with any 
   environment strings entered through the SET command. 
    The environment that you are passed is actually a copy of the invoking 
   process's environment. If your application terminates and stays resident 
   through int 27h, you should be aware that the copy of the environment passed 
   to you is static. That is, it will not change even if subsequent PATH,
   PROMPT, or SET commands are issued.
    The size of the environment may be changed from its default of 160 bytes
   by using the SHELL= command in the config.sys from in DOS version 3.1 up,
   or COMMAND.COM may be patched in earlier versions.
 
   The environment can be used to transfer information between processes or to
   store strings for later use by application programs. The environment is
   always located on a paragraph boundary. This is its format:
        byte    ASCIIZ string 1
        byte    ASCIIZ string 2
            ....
        byte    ASCIIZ string n
        byte    of zeros (0)
   Typically the environment strings have the form:
        NAME = VALUE
   The length of NAME or VALUE can be anything desired as long as it still fits
   into the 123 byte space (4 bytes are used by "SET ").
   Following the byte of zeros in the environment, a WORD indicates the number 
   of other strings following. 

   If the environment is part of an EXECed command interpreter, it is followed 
   by a copy of the DS:DX filename passed to the child process. A zero value 
   causes the newly created process to inherit the parent's environment.

3) Offset 80h in the PSP contains code to invoke the DOS function dispatcher.
   Thus, by placing the desired function number in AH, a program can issue a
   long call to PSP+50h to invoke a DOS function rather than issuing an int 21h.

4) The disk transfer address (DTA) is set to 80h (default DTA in PSP).

5) File Control Blocks 5Ch and 6Ch are formatted from the first two parameters 
   entered when the command was invoked. Note that if either parameter contained
   a path name, then the corresponding FCB will contain only a valid drive
   number. The filename field will not be valid.

6) An unformatted parameter area at 81h contains all the characters entered
   after the command name (including leading and imbedded delimiters), with 80h
   set to the number of characters. If the &lt;, &gt;, or | parameters were entered
   on the command line, they (and the filenames associated with them) will not
   appear in this area, because redirection of standard input and output is
   transparent to applications.

(For EXE files only)
7) DS and ES registers are set to point to the PSP.

8) CS, IP, SS, and SP registers are set to the values passed by the linker.

(For COM files only)
9) For COM files, offset 6 (one word) contains the number of bytes availible in 
   the segment.

10) Register AX reflects the validity of drive specifiers entered with the
    first two parameters as follows:
        AL=0FFh is the first parameter contained an invalid drive specifier,
                otherwise AL=00h.
        AL=0FFh if the second parameter contained an invalid drive specifier, 
                otherwise AL=00h.

11) All four segment registers contain the segment address of the inital 
    allocation block, that starts within the PSP control block. All of user
    memory is allocated to the program. If the program needs to invoke another
    program through the EXEC function call (4Bh), it must first free some memory
    through the SETBLOCK function call to provide space for the program being
    invoked.

12) The Instruction Pointer (IP) is set to 100h.

13) The SP register is set to the end of the program's segment. The segment size
    at offset 6 is rounded down to the paragraph size.

14) A word of zeroes is placed on top of the stack.


 The PSP (with offsets in hexadecimal) is formatted as follows:

1. The first segment of availible memory is in segment (paragraph) form. For 
   example, 1000h would respresent 64k.

2. Offset 2Ch contains the segment address of the environment.

3. Programs must not alter any part of the PSP below offset 5Ch.


PSP (comments):

offset 00h  contains hex bytes CD 20, the int 20h opcode. A program can end
            by making a jump to this location when the CS points to the PSP.
            For normal cases, int 21, function 4Ch should be used.

offset 02h  contains the segment-paragraph address of the end of memory as 
            reported by DOS. (which may not be the same as the real end of RAM).
            Multiply this number by 10h or 16 to get the amount of memory
            availible. ex. 1000h would be 64k.

offset 04h  "reserved or used by DOS" according to Microsoft

offset 05h  contains a long call to the DOS function dispatcher. Programs may 
            jump to this address instead of calling int 21 if they wish. 
            Used by Basic and other CPM object-code translated programs. It is
            slower than standard int 21h.

offset 0Ah, 0Eh, 12h
            vectors (IP, CS)

offset 16h  PSP:16h is the segment address of the invoking program's PSP, which
        *   will most often be COMMAND.COM but perhaps may be a secondary
            non-permanent COMMAND or a multitasking shell, etc. At any rate,
            the resident shell version of COMMAND.COM has PSP:16H = PSP, which
            indicates "don't look any lower in memory" for the command
            interpreter. To find the beginning of the allocation chain, look
            backwards through the PSP link addresses until the link address is
            equal to the PSP segment address that it resides in. This should
            be COMMAND.COM. To find COMMAND.COM's environment, look at the word
            stored at offset 0BD3h (PC-DOS 3.1 only). This is a segment
            address, so look there at offset 0.

       18h  handle alias table (networking). Also you can make PRN go to CON,
        *   CON go to PRN, ERR go to PRN, etc. 0FFh = availible.

offset 2Ch  is the segment:offset address of the environment for the program 
            using this particular PSP. This pointer does not point to
            COMMAND.COM's environment unless it is a second copy of COMMAND.

offset 2Eh  the DWORD at PSP+2Eh is used by DOS to store the calling process's
        *   stack pointer when switching to DOS's own private stack - at the end
            of a DOS function call, SS:SP is restored from this address.

       32h, 34h
        *   table of number of file handles (to 64k of handles!)

offset 40h  2 byte field points to the segment address of COMMAND.COM's PSP in
        *   "weird" EXE files produced by Digital Research RASMPC/LINKPC.
            EXE files created with these tools can cause all sorts of problems
            with standard MSDOS debugging tools.

offset 50h  contains a long call to the DOS int 21 function dispatcher.

offset 5Ch, 65h, 6Ch
            contain FCB information for use with FCB function calls. The first
            FCB may overlay the second if it is an extended call; your program
            should revector these areas to a safe place if you intend to use
            them.

offset 5Ch  16 bytes first command-line argument (formatted as uppercase 11
            character filename)

offset 6Ch  16 bytes second command-line argument (formatted as uppercase 11
            character filename)

offset 7Ch-7Fh
           "reserved or used by DOS"
offset 80h  1 byte number of bytes in command line argument

offset 80h, 81h
            contain the length and value of parameters passed on the command
            line. 

offset 81h  97 bytes unformatted command line and/or default DTA

offset 0FFh contains the DTA
          

 The PSP is created by DOS for all programs and contains most of the information
you need to know about a program running. You can change the environment for
the current process, however, but for the parent process, DOS in this case, you
need to literally backtrack to DOS or COMMAND.COM's PSP. In order to get there
you must look at the current PSP. At offset 16h of the current PSP segment,
there a 2 byte segment address to the parent or previous process PSP.
 From there you can manipulate the enviroment by looking at offset 2Ch. As you
know, at offset 2Ch, there is 2 byte segment address to the environment block.

Try this under debug and explore the addresses located at these offsets;

MEMORY CONTROL BLOCKS����������������������������������������������������������

 DOS keeps track of allocated and availible memory blocks, and provides four
function calls for application programs to communicate their memory needs to 
DOS. These calls are:
              48h --- allocate memory                 (MALLOC)
              49h --- free allocated memory
              4Ah --- modify allocated memory blocks  (SETBLOCK)
              4Bh --- load or execute program         (EXEC)

DOS manages memory as follows:

 DOS build a control block for each block of memory, whether free or allocated.
For example, if a program issues an "allocate" (48h), DOS locates a block of
free memory that satisfies the request, and then "carves" the requested memory 
out of that block. The requesting program is passed the location of the first 
byte of the block that was allocated for it - a memory management control block,
describing the allocated block, has been built for the allocated block and a 
second memory management control block describes the amount of space left in the
original free block of memory. When you do a SETBLOCK to shrink an allocated 
block, DOS builds a memory management control block for the area being freed and
adds it to the chain of control blocks. Thus, any program that changed memory 
that is not allocated to it stands a chance of destroying a DOS memory 
management control block. This causes unpredictable results that don't show up 
until an activity is performed where DOS uses its chain of control blocks. The 
normal result is a memory allocation error, which means a system reset will be 
required.

 When a program (command or application program) is to be loaded, DOS uses the 
EXEC function call 4Bh to perform the loading.

 This is the same function call that is availible to applications programs for 
loading other programs. This function call has two options:

      Function 00h, to load and execute a program (this is what the command
                    processor uses to load and execute external commands)

      Function 03h, to load an overlay (program) without executing it.

 Although both functions perform their loading in the same way (relocation is 
performed for EXE files) their handling of memory management is different.

FUNCTION 0: For function 0 to load and execute a program, EXEC first allocates 
the largest availible block of memory (the new program's PSP will be at offset 
0 in that block). Then EXEC loads the program. Thus, in most cases, the new 
program owns all the memory from its PSP to the end of memory, including memory
occupied by the transient parent of COMMAND.COM. If the program were to issue 
its own EXEC function call to load and execute another program, the request 
would fail because no availible memory exists to load the new program into.

NOTE: For EXE programs, the amount of memory allocated is the size of the 
      program's memory image plus the value in the MAX_ALLOC field of the file's
      header (offset 0Ch, if that much memory is availible. If not, EXEC 
      allocates the size of the program's memory image plus the value in the 
      MIN_ALLOC field in the header (offset 0Ah). These fields are set by the 
      Linker).

 A well-behaved program uses the SETBLOCK function call when it receives 
control, to shrink its allocated memory block down to the size it really needs.
A COM program should remember to set up its own stack before doing the SETBLOCK,
since it is likely that the default stack supplied by DOS lies in the area of 
memory being used. This frees unneeded memory, which can be used for loading 
other programs.

 If the program requires additional memory during processing, it can obtain 
the memory using the allocate function call and later free it using the free 
memory function call.

 When a program is loaded using EXEC function call 00h exits, its initial 
allocation block (the block beginning with its PSP) is automatically freed 
before the calling program regains control. It is the responsibility of all 
programs to free any memory they allocate before exiting to the calling 
program.

 FUNCTION 3: For function 3, to load an overlay, no PSP is built and EXEC 
assumes the calling program has already allocated memory to load the new program
into - it will NOT allocate memory for it. Thus the calling program should 
either allow for the loading of overlays when it determines the amount of memory
to keep when issuing the SETBLOCK call, or should initially free as much memory 
as possible. The calling program should then allocate a block (based on the size
of the program to be loaded) to hold the program that will be loaded using the 
"load overlay" call. Note that "load overlay" does not check to see if the 
calling program actually owns the memory block it has been instructed to load 
into - it assumes the calling program has followed the rules. If the calling 
program does not own the memory into which the overlay is being loaded, there is
a chance the program being loaded will overlay one of the control blocks that 
DOS uses to keep track of memory blocks.

 Programs loaded using function 3 should not issue any SETBLOCK calls since
they don't own the memory they are operating in. (This memory is owned by the
calling program)

 Because programs loaded using function 3 are given control directly by (and 
return contrrol directly to) the calling program, no memory is automatically 
freed when the called program exits. It is up to the calling program to 
determine the disposition of the memory that had been occupied by the exiting 
program. Note that if the exiting program had itself allocated any memory, it 
is responsible for freeing that memory before exiting.

 Memory control blocks, sometimes called "arena headers" after their UNIX 
counterpart, are 16 bytes long. Only the first 5 bytes are used. 16 bytes are
used for the memory control block, which always starts at a paragraph boundary.
When DOS call 48h is made to allocate "x" many paragraphs of memory, the amount
used up is actually one more than the figure in the BX register to provide
space for the associated memory control block. The location of the memory
control block is at the paragraph immediately before the segment value returned
in AX by the DOS function 48h call i.e. ((AX-1):0).

byte 1    will always have the value of 4Dh or 5Ah. The value 5Ah (Z) indicates
          the block is the last in a chain, all memory above it is unused. 4Dh
          (M) means that the block is intermediate in a chain, the memory above
          it belongs to the next program or to DOS.

byte 2,3  hold the PSP segment address of the program that owns the
          corresponding block of memory. A value of 0 means the block is free
          to be claimed, any other value represents a segment address.

byte 3, 4 indicate the size in paragraphs of the memory block. If you know the
          address of the first block, you can find the next block by adding the
          length of the memory block plus 1 to the segment address of the
          control block. Finding the first block can be difficult, as this
          varies according to the DOS version and the configuration. 

 The remaining 11 bytes are not currently used by DOS, and may contain "trash" 
characters left in memory from previous applications.

 If DOS determines that the allocation chain of memory control blocks has been 
corrupted, it will halt the system and display the message "Memory Allocation 
Error", and the system will halt, requiring a reboot.

 Each memory block consists of a signature byte (4Dh or 5Ah) then a word which
is the PSP value of the owner of the block (which allocated it), followed by a 
word which is the size in paragraphs of the block. The last block has a 
signature of 5Ah. All others have 4Dh. If the owner is 0000 then the block is 
free.

 Once a memory control block has been created it should only be manipulated
with the appropriate DOS function calls. Accidentally writing over any of the
first 5 bytes of a memory control block can cause a memory allocation error 
and cause the system to lock up. If the first byte is overwritten with
something other than an 'M' or a 'Z' then DOS will complain with an error
return code of 7 signifying "Memory Control Blocks destroyed". However, should
you change the ownership or block size bytes, you've had it.

 When a .COM program is first loaded by DOS and given control, the memory
control block immediately preceding the Program Segment Prefix contains the
following data:

          ID    = 'Z'
          Owner = segment address of PSP (= CS register of .COM program)
          Size  = number of available paragraphs in DOS memory pool

  An .EXE file will have the following data in the memory control block for
the program (just prior to the PSP):

          ID    = 'M'
          Owner = segment address of PSP (= DS register of program)
          Size  = the number of paragraphs allocated to the program according
                  to the information in the .EXE program header

 In the case of an .EXE program file the amount of memory allocated depends
on the contents of the program header which informs the DOS loader how much to
allocate for each of the segments in the program. With an .EXE program file
there will always be a 'Z' memory control block created in memory immediately
after the end of the space allocated to the program itself.

 One important fact to remember about DOS memory allocation is that blocks of
RAM allocated by different calls to DOS function 48H will NOT be contiguous. At
the very best, they will be separated by the 16 bytes of the memory control
block, and at worst they could be anywhere in RAM that DOS manages to find a
existing memory control block of sufficient size to accomodate the memory
request.

 DOS treats the memory control blocks as a kind of linked list (term used
loosely). It uses the earlier MCBs to find the later ones by calculating the
location of the next one from the size of the prior one. As such, erasing any
of the MCB data in the chain of MCBs will upset DOS severely, as each call for
a new memory allocation causes DOS to scan the whole chain of MCBs looking for
a free one that is large enough to fulfill the request.

 A separate MCB is created for the DOS environment strings at each program
load, so there will be many copies of the environment strewn through memory
when you have a lot of memory resident programs loaded. The memory control
blocks for the DOS environment strings are not returned to the DOS memory pool
if the program goes resident, as DOS will need to copy this enviroment for the
next program loaded.

FILE MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS������������������������������������������������������

 Use DOS function calls to create, open, close, read, write, rename, find, and 
erase files. There are two sets of function calls that DOS provides for support
of file management. They are:

   * File Control Block function calls   (0Fh-24h)
   * Handle function calls               (39h-69h)

 Handle function calls are easier to use and are more powerful than FCB calls.
Microsoft recommends that the handle function calls be used when writing new
programs. DOS 3.0 up have been curtailing use of FCB function calls; it is
possible that future versions of DOS may not support FCB function calls.

 The following table compares the use of FCB calls to Handle function calls:

   ��������������������������������������������������������������������������

 The only reason an application should use FCB function calls is to maintain
the ability to run under DOS 1.x. To to this, the program may use only function
calls 00h-2Eh. Though the FCB function calls are frowned upon, many of the 
introductory assembly language programming texts use the FCB calls as examples.



FCB FUNCTION CALLS ������������������������������������������������������������

 FCB function calls require the use of one File Control Block per open file, 
which is maintained by the application program and DOS. The application program
supplies a pointer to the FCB and fills in ther appropriate fields required by 
the specific function call. An FCB function call can perform file management on
any valid drive, but only in the current logged directory. By using the current
block, current record, and record length fields of the FCB, you can perform 
sequential I/O by using the sequential read or write function calls. Random I/O
can be performed by filling in the random record and record length fields. 

 Several possible uses of FCB type calls are considered programming errors and 
should not be done under any circumstances to avoid problems with file sharing
and compatibility with later versions of DOS.
 Some errors are:
1) If program uses the same FCB structure to access more than one open file. By
   opening a file using an FCB, doing I/O, and then replacing the filename field
   in the file control block with a new filename, a program can open a second
   file using the same FCB. This is invalid because DOS writes control info-
   rmation about the file into the reserved fields of the FCB. If the program
   then replaces the filename field with the original filename and then tries to
   perform I/O on this file, DOS may become confused because the control info-
   rmation has been changed. An FCB should never be used to open a second file
   without closing the one that is currently open. If more than one File Control
   Block is to be open concurrently, separate FCBs should be used.

2) A program should never try to use the reserved fields in the FCB, as the
   function of the fields changes with different versions of DOS.

3) A delete or a rename on a file that is currently open is considered an error
   and should not be attempted by an application program.

 It is also good programming practice to close all files when I/O is done. This
avoids potential file sharing problems that require a limit on the number of
files concurrently open using FCB function calls.



HANDLE FUNCTION CALLS����������������������������������������������������������

 The recommended method of file management is by using the extended "handle" 
set of function calls. These calls are not restricted to the current directory.
Also, the handle calls allow the application program to define the type of 
access that other processes can have concurrently with the same file if the file
is being shared.

 To create or open a file, the application supplies a pointer to an ASCIIZ 
string giving the name and location of the file. The ASCIIZ string contains an 
optional drive letter, optional path, mandatory file specification, and a 
terminal byte of 00h. The following is an example of an ASCIIZ string:

                  format [drive][path] filename.ext,0

                      DB "A:\path\filename.ext",0

 If the file is being created, the application program also supplies the 
attribute of the file. This is a set of values that defines the file read 
only, hidden, system, directory, or volume label.

 If the file is being opened, the program can define the sharing and access 
modes that the file is opened in. The access mode informs DOS what operations 
your program will perform on this file (read-only, write-only, or read/write) 
The sharing mode controls the type of operations other processes may perform 
concurrently on the file. A program can also control if a child process inherits
the open files of the parent. The sharing mode has meaning only if file sharing
is loaded when the file is opened.

 To rename or delete a file, the appplication program simply needs to provide 
a pointer to the ASCIIZ string containing the name and location of the file 
and another string with the new name if the file is being renamed.

 The open or create function calls return a 16-bit value referred to as the 
file handle. To do any I/O to a file, the program uses the handle to reference
the file. Once a file is opened, a program no longer needs to maintain the 
ASCIIZ string pointing to the file, nor is there any need to stay in the same 
directory. DOS keeps track of the location of the file regardless of what 
directory is current.

 Sequential I/O can be performed using the handle read (3Fh) or write (40h) 
function calls. The offset in the file that IO is performed to is automatically
moved to the end of what was just read or written. If random I/O is desired, the
LSEEK (42h) function call can be used to set the offset into the file where I/O 
is to be performed.


SPECIAL FILE HANDLES�����������������������������������������������������������

 DOS reserves five special file handles for use by itself and applications 
programs. They are:
������������������������������������������������������������������������������Ŀ
� 0000h � STDIN  � standard input device        (input can be redirected)      �
� 0001h � STDOUT � standard output device       (output can be redirected)     �
� 0002h � STDERR � standard error output device (output cannot be redirected)  �
� 0004h � STDAUX � standard auxiliary device                                   �
� 0005h � STDPRN � standard printer device                                     �
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������

 These handles are predefined by DOS and can be used by an application program.
They do not need to be opened by a program, although a program can close these 
handles. STDIN should be treated as a read-only file, and STDOUT and STDERR 
should be treated as write-only files. STDIN and STDOUT can be redirected. All 
handles inherited by a process can be redirected, but not at the command line.
 These handles are very useful for doing I/O to and from the console device. 
For example, you could read input from the keyboard using the read (3Fh) 
function call and file handle 0000h (STDIN), and write output to the console 
screen with the write function call (40h) and file handle 0001h (STDOUT). If 
you wanted an output that could not be redirected, you could output it using 
file handle 0002h (STDERR). This is very useful for error messages that must 
be seen by a user.

 File handles 0003h (STDAUX) and 0004h (STDPRN) can be both read from and 
written to. STDAUX is typically a serial device and STDPRN is usually a parallel
device.


ASCII and BINARY MODE����������������������������������������������������������

 I/O to files is done in binary mode. This means that the data is read or 
written without modification. However, DOS can also read or write to devices in
ASCII mode. In ASCII mode, DOS does some string processing and modification to 
the characters read and written. The predefined handles are in ASCII mode when 
initialized by DOS. All other file handles that don't refer to devices are in 
binary mode. A program, can use the IOCTL (44h) function call to set the mode 
that I/O is to a device. The predefined file handles are all devices, so the 
mode can be changed from ASCII to binary via IOCTL. Regular file handles that 
are not devices are always in binary mode and cannot be changed to ASCII mode.

 The ASCII/BINARY bit was called "raw" in DOS 2.x, but it is called ASCII/BINARY
in DOS 3.x.

 The predefined file handles STDIN (0000h) and STDOUT (0001h) and STDERR 
(0002h) are all duplicate handles. If the IOCTL function call is used to change
the mode of any of these three handles, the mode of all three handles is 
changed. For example, if IOCTL was used to change STDOUT to binary mode, then 
STDIN and STDERR would also be changed to binary mode.



FILE I/O IN BINARY (RAW) MODE��������������������������������������������������

The following is true when a file is read in binary mode:

1)  The characters ^S (scroll lock), ^P (print screen), ^C (control break) are 
    not checked for during the read. Therefore, no printer echo occurs if ^S or
    ^P are read.
2)  There is no echo to STDOUT (0001h).
3)  Read the number of specified bytes and returns immediately when the last 
    byte is received or the end of file reached.
4)  Allows no editing of the ine input using the function keys if the input is 
    from STDIN (0000h).


The following is true when a file is written to in binary mode:

1)  The characters ^S (scroll lock), ^P (print screen), ^C (control break) are 
    not checked for during the write. Therefore, no printer echo occurs.
2)  There is no echo to STDOUT (0001h).
3)  The exact number of bytes specified are written.
4)  Does not caret (^) control characters. For example, ctrl-D is sent out as 
    byte 04h instead of the two bytes ^ and D.
5)  Does not expand tabs into spaces. 


FILE I/O IN ASCII (COOKED) MODE������������������������������������������������

The following is true when a file is read in ASCII mode:

1)  Checks for the characters ^C,^S, and ^P.
2)  Returns as many characters as there are in the device input buffer, or the 
    number of characters requested, whichever is less. If the number of 
    characters requested was less than the number of characters in the device 
    buffer, then the next read will address the remaining characters in the 
    buffer.
3)  If there are no more bytes remaining in the device input buffer, read a 
    line (terminated by ^M) into the buffer. This line may be edited with the 
    function keys. The characters returned terminated with a sequence of 0Dh,
    0Ah (^M,^J) if the number of characters requested is sufficient to include
    them. For example, if 5 characters were requested, and only 3 were entered
    before the carriage return (0Dh or ^M) was presented to DOS from the console
    device, then the 3 characters entered and 0Dh and 0Ah would be returned. 
    However, if 5 characters were requested and 7 were entered before the 
    carriage return, only the first 5 characters would be returned. No 0Dh,0Ah 
    sequence would be returned in this case. If less than the number of 
    characters requested are entered when the carriage return is received, the
    characters received and 0Dh,0Ah would be returned. The reason the 0Ah 
    (linefeed or ^J) is added to the returned characters is to make the devices
    look like text files.
4)  If a 1Ah (^Z) is found, the input is terminated at that point. No 0Dh,0Ah 
    (CR,LF) sequence is added to the string.
5)  Echoing is performed.
6)  Tabs are expanded.


The following is true when a file is written to in ASCII mode:

1)  The characters ^S,^P,and ^C are checked for during the write operation.
2)  Expands tabs to 8-character boundaries and fills with spaces (20h).
3)  Carets control characters, for example, ^D is written as two bytes, ^ and D.
4)  Bytes are output until the number specified is output or a ^Z is 
    encountered. The number actually output is returned to the user.


NUMBER OF OPEN FILES ALLOWED���������������������������������������������������

 The number of files that can be open concurrently is restricted by DOS. This 
number is determined by how the file is opened or created (FCB or handle 
function call) and the number specified by the FCBS and FILES commands in the 
CONFIG.SYS file. The number of files allowed open by FCB function calls and the
number of files that can be opened by handle type calls are independent of one 
another.


RESTRICTIONS ON FCB USAGE������������������������������������������������������

 If file sharing is not loaded using the SHARE command, there are no 
restrictions on the nuumber of files concurrently open using FCB function calls.

 However, when file sharing is loaded, the maximum number of FCBs open is set
by the the FCBS command in the CONFIG.SYS file.

 The FCBS command has two values you can specify, 'm' and 'n'. The value for 
'm' specifies the number of files that can be opened by FCBs, and the value 'n' 
specifies the number of FCBs that are protected from being closed.

 When the maximum number of FCB opens is exceeded, DOS automatically closes the
least recently used file. Any attempt to access this file results in an int 24h
critical error message "FCB not availible". If this occurs while an application
program is running, the value specified for 'm' in the FCBS command should be
increased.

 When DOS determines the least recently used file to close, it does not include
the first 'n' files opened, therefore the first 'n' files are protected from 
being closed.


RESTRICTIONS ON HANDLE USAGE���������������������������������������������������

 The number of files that can be open simultaneously by all processes is 
determined by the FILES command in the CONFIG.SYS file. The number of files a 
single process can open depends on the value specified for the FILES command. If
FILES is greater than or equal to 20, a single process can open 20 files. If 
FILES is less than 20, the process can open less than 20 files. This value 
includes three predefined handles: STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR. This means only
17 additional handles can be added. DOS 3.3 includes a function to use more than
20 files per application.


ALLOCATING SPACE TO A FILE�����������������������������������������������������

 Files are not nescessarily written sequentially on a disk. Space is allocated 
as needed and the next location availible on the disk is allocated as space for
the next file being written. Therefore, if considerable file generation has
taken place, newly created files will not be written in sequential sectors.
However, due to the mapping (chaining) of file space via the File Allocation
Table (FAT) and the function calls availible, any file may be used in either a
sequential or random manner.

 Space is allocated in increments called clusters. Cluster size varies 
according to the media type. An application program should not concern itself 
with the way that DOS allocates space to a file. The size of a cluster is only 
important in that it determines the smallest amount of space that can be 
allocated to a file. A disk is considered full when all clusters have been 
allocated to files.



MSDOS / PCDOS DIFFERENCES������������������������������������������������������

 There is a problem of compatibility between MS-DOS and IBM PC-DOS having to 
do with FCB Open and Create. The IBM 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0 documentation of OPEN
(call 0Fh) contains the following statement:

 "The current block field (FCB bytes C-D) is set to zero [when an FCB is 
opened]."

 This statement is NOT true of MS-DOS 1.25 or MS-DOS 2.00. The difference is
intentional, and the reason is CP/M 1.4 compatibility. Zeroing that field is 
not CP/M compatible. Some CP/M programs will not run when machine translated if
that field is zeroed. The reason it is zeroed in the IBM versions is that IBM 
specifically requested that it be zeroed. This is the reason for the complaints
from some vendors about the fact that IBM MultiPlan will not run under MS-DOS.
It is probably the reason that some other IBM programs don't run under MS-DOS.

NOTE: Do what all MS/PC-DOS systems programs do: Set every single FCB field you
want to use regardless of what the documentation says is initialized.


.COM FILE STRUCTURE������������������������������������������������������������

 The COM file structure was designed for DOS 1.0 and maximum compatibility 
with programs ported from the CP/M operating system. COM files normally 
comprise one segment only.


.EXE FILE STRUCTURE������������������������������������������������������������

 The EXE file is the native mode for DOS. EXE files may make use of multiple 
segments for code, stack, and data. The design of the EXE file reflects the 
segmented design of the Intel 80x86 CPU architecture. EXE files may be as 
large as availible memory and may make references to specific segment addresses.


 The EXE files produced by the Linker program consist of two parts, control and
relocation information and the load module itself.

 The control and relocation information, which is described below, is at the 
beginning of the file in an area known as the header. The load module 
immediately follows the header. The load module begins in the memory image of 
the module contructed by the Linker.

 When you are loading a file with the name *.EXE, DOS does NOT assume that it
is an EXE format file. It looks at the first two bytes for a signature telling
it that it is an EXE file. If it has the proper signature, then the load 
proceeds. Otherwise, it presumes the file to be a .COM format file.

 If the file has the EXE signature, then the internal consistency is checked.
Pre-2.0 versions of MSDOS did not check the signature byte for EXE files.

 The .EXE format can support programs larger than 64K. It does this by 
allowing separate segments to be defined for code, data, and the stack, each 
of which can be up to 64K long. Programs in EXE format may contain explicit 
references to segment addresses. A header in the EXE file has information for 
DOS to resolve these references.


The .EXE header is formatted as follows:
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������Ŀ
� Offset  �                      C O N T E N T S                              �
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������Ĵ

�         � module image size by 512)                                         �
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������Ĵ

�����������������������������������������������������������������������������Ĵ

�����������������������������������������������������������������������������Ĵ
� 0Ch-0Dh � Maximum number of 16 byte paragraphs required above the end of    �
�         � the loaded program. If the minimum and maximum number of          �
�         � paragraphs are both zero, the program will be loaded as high in   �
�         � memory as possible.                                               �

�����������������������������������������������������������������������������Ĵ
� 18h-19h � Displacement in bytes of the first relocation item in the file.   �
�����������������������������������������������������������������������������Ĵ
� 1Ah-1Bh � Overlay number (0 for the resident part of the program)           �
�������������������������������������������������������������������������������



THE RELOCATION TABLE�����������������������������������������������������������

 The word at 18h locates the first entry in the relocation table. The 
relocation table is made up of a variable number of relocation items. The number
of items is contained at offset 06-07. The relocation item contains two fields
- a 2 byte offset value, followed by a 2 byte segment value. These two fields 
represent the displacement into the load module before the module is given 
control. The process is called relocation and is accomplished as follows:

1. The formatted part of the header is read into memory. Its size is 1Bh.

2. A portion of memory is allocated depending on the size of the load module
   and the allocation numbers in offsets 0Ah-0Ch and 0Ch-0Dh. DOS always
   tries to allocate 0FFFFh paragraphs. Since this call will always fail,
   the function returns the amount of free memory. If this block is larger
   than the minimum specified at offset 0Ah and the loaded program size,
   DOS will allocate the size specified at offset 0Ch or the largest free
   memory space, whichever is less.

3. A Program Segment Prefix is built following the resident portion of the 
   program that is performing the load operation.

4. The formatted part of the header is read into memory (its size is at 
   offset 08h)

5. The load module size is determined by subtracting the header size from the 
   file size. Offsets 04h and 08h can be used for this calculation. The 
   actual size is downward adjusted based on the contents of offsets 02-03. 
   Note that all files created by the Linker programs prior to version 1.10 
   always placed a value of 4 at this location, regardless of the actual 
   program size. Therefore, Microsoft recommends that this field be ignored if 
   it contains a value of 4. Based on the setting of the high/low loader switch,
   an appropriate segment is determined for loading the load module. This
   segment is called the start segment.

6. The load module is read into memory beginning at the start segment. The
   relocation table is an ordered list of relocation items. The first relocation
   item is the one that has the lowest offset in the file. 

7. The relocation table items are read into a work area one or more at a time.

8. Each relocation table item segment value is added to the start segment value.
   The calculated segment, in conjunction with the relocation item offset value,
   points to a word in the load module to which is added the start segment 
   value. The result is placed back into the word in the load module.

9. Once all the relocation items have been processed, the SS and SP registers 
   are set from the values in the header and the start segment value is added 
   to SS. The ES and DS registers are set to the segment address of the program 
   segment prefix. The start segment value is added to the header CS register 
   value. The result, along with the header IP value, is used to give the 
   module control.


"NEW" .EXE FORMAT (Microsoft Windows and OS/2)���������������������������������

 The "old" EXE format is documented here. The "new" EXE format puts more 
information into the header section and is currently used in applications that 
run under Microsoft Windows. The linker that creates these files comes with the 
Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit and is called LINK4. If you try to 
run a Windows-linked program under DOS, you will get the error message "This 
program requires Microsoft Windows".

PIF Files
  PIF stands for "Program Information File". The PIF format was developed by 
IBM for use with TopView, its multitasking manager. Microsoft also uses PIF 
files to pass information regarding the amount of memory and type of I/O a 
program running under Microsoft Windows requires.
  The actual internal format of the PIF files is documented in the IBM TopView 
Programmers' ToolKit.

STANDRD FILE CONTROL BLOCK�����������������������������������������������������

 The standard file control block is defined as follows, with offsets in hex:

������������������������������������������������������������������������������Ŀ

��������������������������������������������������������������������������������

note 1) An unopened FCB consists of the FCB prefix (if used), drive number, and 
        filename.ext properly filled in. An open FCB is one in which the 
        remaining fields have been filled in by the CREAT or OPEN function 
        calls.
     2) Bytes 0-5 and 32-36 must be set by the user program. Bytes 16-31 are set
        by DOS and must not be changed by user programs.
     3) All word fields are stored with the least significant byte first. For 
        example, a record length of 128 is stored as 80h at offset 14, and 00h 
        at offset 15.



EXTENDED FILE CONTROL BLOCK����������������������������������������������������

 The extended file control block is used to create or search for files in the 
disk directory that have special attributes.

It adds a 7 byte prefix to the FCB, formatted as follows:

������������������������������������������������������������������������������Ŀ

�   0   � Flag byte containing 0FFh to indicate an extended FCB.               �
������������������������������������������������������������������������������Ĵ

������������������������������������������������������������������������������Ĵ
�  6-7  � Attribute byte. Refer to function call 11h (search first) for        �
�       � details on using the attribute bits during directory searches. This  �
�       � function is present to allow applications to define their own files  �
�       � as hidden (and thereby excluded from normal directory searches) and  �
�       � to allow selective directory searches.                               �
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������
                                     
 Any reference in the DOS function calls to an FCB, whether opened or unopened,
may use either a normal or extended FCB. If you are using an extended FCB, the 
appropriate register should be set to the first byte of the prefix, rather than
the drive-number field.

 Common practice is to refer to the extended FCB as a negative offset from the 
first byte of a standard File Control Block.

THE DOS AREA����������������������������������������������������������� 8**1

 All disks and diskettes formatted by DOS are created with a sector size of 512
bytes. The DOS area (entire area for a diskette, DOS partition for hard disks)
is formatted as follows:

        ������������������������������������������������������������Ŀ
        �                       D O S   A R E A                      �

        � first copy of the FAT    - variable size                   �

        � data area                - variable depending on disk size �
        ��������������������������������������������������������������

The following sections describe each of the allocated areas:



THE BOOT RECORD�������������������������������������������������������� 8**2

 The boot record resides on track 0, sector 1, side 0 of every diskette
formatted by the DOS FORMAT program. For hard disks the boot record resides on
the first sector of the DOS partition. It is put on all disks to provide an
error message if you try to start up with a nonsystem disk in drive A:. If the
disk is a system disk, the boot record contains a JMP instruction pointing to
the first byte of the operating system.

 If the device is IBM compatible the first sector of the first FAT must be
located at the same sector for all disk types. This is because the FAT sector
is read before the disk type is actually determined.

 The information relating to the BPB for a particular media is kept in the 
disk's boot sector.  The format of the boot sector is:

 The three words at the end return information about the media. The number of
heads is useful for supporting different multihead drives that have the same
storage capacity but a different number of surfaces. The number of hidden
sectors is useful for drive partitioning schemes.

 DOS 3.2 uses a table called the BIOS Parameter Block (BPB) to determine if a
disk has a valid File Allocation Table. The BPB is located in the first sector
of a floppy disk. Although the BPB is supposed to be on every formatted floppy
disk, some earlier versions of DOS did not create a BPB and instead assumed that
the FAT begins at the second sector of the disk and that the first FAT byte
(Media Descriptor Byte) describes the disk format.
 DOS 3.2 reads in the whole of the BPB and tries to use it - although strangely
enough, it seems as if DOS is prepared to cope with a BPB that is more or less
totally blank (it seems to ignore the descriptor byte and treat it as a DSDD
9-sector disk).
 DOS 3.2 determines if a disk has a valid boot sector by examining the first
byte of logical sector 0. If that byte it a jump instruction 0E9h, DOS 3.2
assumes the rest of the sector is a valid boot sector with a BPB. If the first
byte is not 0E9h DOS 3.2 behaves like previous versions, assumes the boot sector
is invalid and uses the first byte of the FAT to determine the media type.
 If the first byte on the disk happens to be 0E9h, but the disk does not have a
BPB, DOS 3.2 will return a disk error message.
 The real problems occur if some of the BPB data is valid and some isn't.
Apparently some OEMs have assumed that DOS would continue to ignore the
formatting data on the disk, and have failed to write much there during FORMAT
except the media descriptor byte (or, worse, have allowed random junk to be
written there). While this error is understandable, and perhaps even
forgiveable, it remains their problem, not IBM's, since the BPB area has always
been documented as containing the format information that IBM DOS 3.2 now
requires to be there.

 When the BPB problems first became evident with DOS 3.2 a number of reports
circulated claiming DOS looked for the letters "IBM" in the OEM ID field. This 
was incorrect. IBM DOS 4.0 *did* check for the letters "IBM" and would refuse
to recognize hard drives formatted under MSDOS 4.0. IBM corrected this with
their 4.01 revision.



THE DOS FILE ALLOCATION TABLE (FAT)������������������������������������ 8**3

 The File Allocation Table, or FAT, has three main purposes:
        1) to mark bad sectors on the media
        2) to determine which sectors are free for use
        3) to determine the physical location(s) of a file on the media.

 DOS uses one of two schemes for defining the File Allocation Table:
        1) a 12-bit FAT, for DOS 1.x, 2.x, all floppies, and small hard disks
        2) a 16-bit FAT, for DOS 3.x+ hard disks from 16.8 to 32Mb

 This section explains how DOS uses the FAT to convert the clusters of a file
into logical sector numbers. It is recommended that system utilities use the
DOS handle calls rather than interpreting the FAT, particularly since
aftermarket disk partitioning or formatting software may have been used.

 The FAT is used by DOS to allocate disk space for files, one cluster at a time.
In DOS 4.0, clusters are referred to as "allocation units." It means the same
things; the smallest logical portion of a drive.

 The FAT consists of a 12 bit entry (1.5 bytes) for each cluster on the disk or
a 16 bit (2 bytes) entry when a hard disk has more than 20740 sectors as is the
case with fixed disks larger than 10Mb.

 The first two FAT entries map a portion of the directory; these FAT entries
contain indicators of the size and format of the disk. The FAT can be in a 12
or 16 bit format. DOS determines whether a disk has a 12 or 16 bit FAT by
looking at the total number of allocation units on a disk. For all diskettes
and hard disks with DOS partitions less than 20,740 sectors, the FAT uses a 12
bit value to map a cluster. For larger partitions, DOS uses a 16 bit value.

 The second, third, and fourth bit applicable for 16 bit FAT bytes always
contains 0FFFFh. The first byte is used as follows:

The third FAT entry begins mapping the data area (cluster 002).

NOTE: These values are provided as a reference. Therefore, programs should not
      make use of these values.

 Each entry contains three hexadecimal characters for 12-bit FATs or four for
16-bit FATs.

The possible entries are:

   12-bit   |   16-bit
            |
      000h  |        0000h   if the cluster is unused and available

      0FF7h |        0FFF7h  bad cluster (if not part of the allocation chain)
            |
0FF0h-0FF7h | 0FFF0h-0FFF7h  to indicate reserved clusters
            |
0FF8h-0FFFh | 0FFF8h-0FFFFh  to indicate the last cluster of a file (EOF)
            |
       xxxH |         xxxxH  any other hexadecimal numbers are the cluster
            |                number of the next cluster in the file. The
            |                cluster number is the first cluster in the file
            |                that is kept in the file's directory entry.

 The file allocation table always occupies the sector or sectors immediately
following the boot record. If the FAT is larger than 1 sector, the sectors
occupy consecutive sector numbers. Two copies of the FAT are written, one
following the other, for integrity. The FAT is read into one of the DOS buffers
whenever needed (open, allocate more space, etc).



12 Bit File Allocation Table .......................................... 8**5

Obtain the starting cluster of the file from the directory entry.

Now, to locate each subsequent sector of the file:

1. Multiply the cluster number just used by 1.5 (each FAT entry is 1.5
   bytes long).
2. The whole part of the product is offset into the FAT, pointing to the entry
   that maps the cluster just used. That entry contains the cluster number of
   the next cluster in the file.
3. Use a MOV instruction to move the word at the calculated FAT into a register.
4. If the last cluster used was an even number, keep the low order 12 bits of
   the register, otherwise, keep the high order 12 bits.
5. If the resultant 12 bits are (0FF8h-0FFFh) no more clusters are in the file.
   Otherwise, the next 12 bits contain the cluster number of the next cluster in
   the file.

  To convert the cluster to a logical sector number (relative sector, such as
that used by int 25h and 26h and DEBUG):

1. Subtract 2 from the cluster number
2. Multiply the result by the number of sectors per cluster.
3. Add the logical sector number of the beginning of the data area.

12-bit FAT if DOS partition is smaller than 32,680 sectors (16.340 MB).



16 Bit File Allocation Table .......................................... 8**6

 Obtain the starting cluster of the file from the directory entry. Now to
locate each subsequent cluster of the file:

1.  Multiply the cluster number used by 2 (each FAT entry is 2 bytes long).
2.  Use the MOV word instruction to move the word at the calculated FAT offset
    into a register.
3.  If the resultant 16 bits are (0FF8h-0FFFFh) no more clusters are in the
    file. Otherwise, the 16 bits contain the cluster number of the next cluster
    in the file.




DOS Disk Directory .................................................... 8**8

 The FORMAT command initially builds the root directory for all disks. Its
location (logical sector number) and the maximum number of entries are
available through the device driver interfaces.

 Since directories other than the root directory are actually files, there is
no limit to the number of entries that they may contain.

 All directory entries are 32 bytes long, and are in the following format:
�������������������������������������������������������������������������������
�offset �  size   �                  DISK DIRECTORY ENTRY

The Data Area ......................................................... 8**9

 Allocation of space for a file (in the data area) is done only when needed
(it is not preallocated). The space is allocated one cluser (unit allocation)
at a time. A cluster is always one or more consecutive sector numbers, and all
of the clusters in a file are "chained" together in the FAT.

 The clusters are arranged on disk to minimize head movement for multisided
media. All of the space on a track (or cylinder) is allocated before moving
on to the next track. This is accomplished by using the sequential sector
numbers on the lowest-numbered head, then all the sector numbers on the next
head, and so on until all sectors of all heads of the track are used. Then the
next sector used will be sector 1 of head 0 on the next track.

 An interesting innovation that was introduced in MS-DOS 3.0: disk space that
is freed by erasing a file is not re-used immediately, unlike earlier versions
of DOS. Instead, free space is obtained from the area not yet used during the
current session, until all of it is used up. Only then will space that is freed
during the current session be re-used.

 This feature minimizes fragmentation of files, since never-before-used space
is always contiguous. However, once any space has been freed by deleting a file,
that advantage vanishes at the next system boot. The feature also greatly
simplifies un-erasing files, provided that the need to do an un-erase is found
during the same session and also provided that the file occupies contiguous
clusters.

 However, when one is using programs which make extensive use of temporary
files, each of which may be created and erased many times during a session,
the feature becomes a nuisance; it forces the permanent files to move farther
and farther into the inner tracks of the disk, thus increasing rather than
decreasing the amount of fragmentation which occurs.

 The feature is implemented in DOS by means of a single 16-bit "last cluster
used" (LCU) pointer for each physical disk drive; this pointer is a part of
the physical drive table maintained by DOS. At boot time, the LCU pointer is
zeroed. Each time another cluster is obtained from the free-space pool (the
FAT), its number is written into the LCU pointer. Each time a fresh cluster
is required, the FAT is searched to locate a free one; in older versions of
DOS this search always began at Cluster 0000, but in 3.x it begins at the
cluster pointed to by the LCU pointer.

 For hard disks, the size of the file allocation table and directory are
determined when FORMAT initializes it and are based on the size of the DOS
partition.

 Some oddball DOS versions specify "zero" heads in their data area. HP's
single-sided disk format (16 256-byte sectors/track, model unknown) uses a
zero-based parameter for the number of heads. Without special device driver
software to "fix" this, these disks are basically unusable by normal DOS.

 A couple of people have reported that the IBM "Gearbox" industrial PC uses
an 800k 3.5 inch floppy with 10 sectors and 80 tracks. I've been unable to
confirm this.

 Files in the data area are not necessarily written sequentially. The data area
space is allocated one cluster at a time, skipping over clusters already
allocated. The first free cluster found is the next cluster allocated,
regardless of its physical location on the disk. This permits the most efficient
utilization of disk space because clusters freed by erasing files can be
allocated for new files. Refer back to the description of the DOS FAT in this
chapter for more information.

 Much of the trouble with AT 1.2 meg drives has been through the inadverdent
use of quad density disks in the high density drives. The high density disks
use a higher-coercivity media than the quads, and quads are not completely
reliable as 1.2Mb. Make sure you have the correct disk for your application.

        all      8"    360 RPM

 The Victor 9000's 5�" floppies could vary their rotational speed as required. 
This allowed them to put 720k on a standard 360k floppy, using a constant 
density throughout.

 The Central Point CopyIIPC Option Board emulates the Macintosh GCR recording 
format by varying the data rate instead of the rotational speed.

 


HARD DISK LAYOUT ...................................................... 8**11

 The DOS hard disk routines perform the following services:

1) Allow multiple operating systems to be installed on the hard disk at the
   same time.

2) Allow a user-selected operating system to be started from the hard disk.

   I) In order to share the hard disk among operating systems, the disk may be
      logically divided into 1 to 4 partitions. The space within a given
      partition is contiguous, and can be dedicated to a specific operating
      system. Each operating system may "own" only one partition in DOS versions
      2.0 through 3.2. DOS 3.3 introduced the "Extended DOS Partition" which
      allows multiple DOS partitions on the same hard disk. FDISK (or a
      similar program from other DOS vendors) utility allows the user to select
      the number, type, and size of each partition. The partition information is
      kept in a partition table that is embedded in the master hard disk boot
      record on the first sector of the disk. The format of this table varies
      from version to version of DOS.

  II) An operating system must consider its partition to be the entire disk,
      and must ensure that its functions and utilities do not access other
      partitions on the disk.

 III) Each partition may contain a boot record on its first sector, and any
      other programs or data that you choose, including a different operating
      system. For example, the DOS FORMAT command may be used to format and
      place a copy of DOS in the DOS partition in the same manner that a
      diskette is formatted. You can use FDISK to designate a partition as
      "active" (bootable). The master hard disk boot record causes that
      partition's boot record to receive control when the system is
      initialized. Additional disk partitions could be FORTH, UNIX, Pick,
      CP/M-86, OS/2 HPFS, Concurrent DOS, Xenix, or the UCSD p-System.



SYSTEM INITIALIZATION ................................................. 8**12

The boot sequence is as follows:

1. System initialization first attempts to load an operating system from
   diskette drive A. If the drive is not ready or a read error occurs, it then
   attempts to read a master hard disk boot record on the first sector of the
   first hard disk in the system. If unsuccessful, or if no hard disk is
   present, it invokes ROM BASIC in an IBM PC or displays a disk error
   message on most compatibles.

2. If initialization is successful, the master hard disk boot record is given
   control and it examines the partition table embedded within it. If one of
   the entries indicates an active (bootable) partition, its boot record is
   read from the partition's first sector and given control.

3. If none of the partitions is bootable, ROM BASIC is invoked on an IBM PC or
    a disk error on most compatibles.

4. If any of the boot indicators are invalid, or if more than one indicator is
   marked as bootable, the message "INVALID PARTITION TABLE "is displayed and
   the system stops.

5. If the partition's boot record cannot be successfully read within five
   retries due to read errors, the message "ERROR LOADING OPERATING SYSTEM"
   appears and the system stops.

6. If the partition's boot record does not contain a valid "signature", the
   message "MISSING OPERATING SYSTEM" appears, and the system stops.

NOTE: When changing the size or location of any partition, you must ensure that
      all existing data on the disk has been backed up. The partitioning program
      will destroy the data on the disk.

 System programmers designing a utility to initialize/manage a hard disk must
provide the following functions at a minimum:

1. Write the master disk boot record/partition table to the disk's first
   sector to initialize it.

2. Perform partitioning of the disk - that is, create or update the partition
   table information (all fields for the partition) when the user wishes
   to create a partition. This may be limited to creating a partition for only
   one type of operating system, but must allow repartitoning the entire disk,
   or adding a partition without interfering with existing partitions (user's
   choice).

3. Provide a means for marking a user-specified partition as bootable and
   resetting the bootable indicator bytes for all other partitions at the same
   time.

4. Such utilities should not change or move any partition information that
   belongs to another operating system.




BOOT RECORD/PARTITION TABLE ........................................... 8**13

 A boot record must be written on the first sector of all hard disks, and
must contain the following:

1. Code to load and give control to the boot record for one of four possible
   operating systems.

2. A partition table at the end of the boot record. Each table entry is 16
   bytes long, and contains the starting and ending cylinder, sector, and head
   for each of four possible partitions, as well as the number of sectors
   preceding the partition and the number of sectors occupied by the partition.
   The "boot indicator" byte is used by the boot record to determine if one of
   the partitions contains a loadable operating system. FDISK initialization
   utilities mark a user-selected partition as "bootable" by placing a value
   of 80h in the corresponding partition's boot indicator (setting all other
   partitions' indicators to 0 at the same time). The presence of the 80h tells
   the standard boot routine to load the sector whose location is contained in
   the following three bytes. That sector is the actual boot record for the
   selected operating system, and it is responsible for the remainder of the
   system's loading process (as it is from the diskette). All boot records are
   loaded at absolute address 0:7C00.

The partition table with its offsets into the boot record is:

 Boot indicator (boot ind): The boot indicator byte must contain 0 for a non-
bootable partition or 80h for a bootable partition. Only one partition can be
marked as bootable at a time.

 System Indicator (sys ind): The sys ind field contains an indicator of the
operating system that "owns" the partition. IBM PC-DOS can only "own" one
partition, though some versions of MSDOS allow all four partitions to be used
by DOS.

 The system indicators are:

 There are ID bytes for proprietary formatting schemes. Some manufacturers
(such as Zenith, Wyse, and Tandon) diddle with these system bytes to implement
more than one DOS partition per disk.

note 1) Xenix doesn't like extended DOS partitions a'la DOS 3.3, limiting you
        to a DOS partition of 32Mb. Xenix doesn't recognize DOS 4.0x at all,
        so to use it you need to boot from a floppy. Early versions of OS/2
        also have this problem.
    2)  I have found one source listing Minix partitions as "40" and some
        Unix partitions as "63".  I don't know if these are decimal or
        hexadecimal figures.

 Cylinder (CYL) and Sector (S): The 1 byte fields labelled CYL contain the low
order 8 bits of the cylinder number - the high order 2 bits are in the high
order 2 bits of the sector (S) field. This corresponds with the ROM BIOS
interrupt 13h (disk I/O) requirements, to allow for a 10 bit cylinder number.

 The fields are ordered in such a manner that only two MOV instructions are
required to properly set up the DX and CX registers for a ROM BIOS call to
load the appropriate boot record (hard disk booting is only possible from the
first hard disk in the system, where a BIOS drive number of 80h corresponds
to the boot indicator byte).

 All partitions are allocated in cylinder multiples and begin on sector 1,
head 0, with the exception that the partition that is allocated at the beginning
of the disk starts at sector 2, to account for the hard disk's master boot
record.

 Relative (starting) Sector: The number of sectors preceding each partition
on the disk is kept in this 4 byte field. This value is determined by counting
the sectors beginning with cylinder 0, sector 1, head 0 of the disk, and
incrementing the sector, head, and then track values up to the beginning of
the partition. This, if the disk has 17 sectors per track and 4 heads, and the
second partition begins at cylinder 1, sector 1, head 0, then the partition's
starting relative sector is 68 (decimal) - there were 17 sectors on each of 4
heads on 1 track allocated ahead of it. The field is stored with the least
significant word first.

 Number of sectors (#sects): The number of sectors allocated to the partition
is kept in the "# of sects" field. This is a 4 byte field stored least
significant word first.

 Signature: The last 2 bytes of the boot record (55AAh) are used as a signature
to identify a valid boot record. Both this record and the partition boot record
are required to contain the signature at offset 1FEh.



HARD DISK TECHNICAL INFORMATION ....................................... 8**14

 Western Digital's hard disk installation manuals make the claim that MSDOS
can support only 2 hard drives. This is entirely false, and their purpose for
making the claim is unclear. DOS merely performs a function call pointed at
the hard disk driver, which is normally in one of three locations; a ROM at
absolute address C:800, the main BIOS ROM if the machine is an AT, or a device
driver installed through the CONFIG.SYS file. Two hard disk controller cards
can normally not reside in the same machine due to lack of interrupt
arbitration. Perstor's ARLL controller and some cards marketed by Novell can
coexist with other controllers. Perstor's technical department has had four
controllers and eight hard disks in the same IBM XT functioning concurrently.

 A valid hard disk has a boot record arranged in the following manner:

        db      drive           ; 0 or 80h  (80h marks a bootable, active
                                             partition)
        db      head1           ; starting head
        dw      trksec1         ; starting track/sector (CX value for INT 13)
        db      system          ; SYS IND ID from table above
        db      head2           ; ending head
        dw      trksec2         ; ending track/sector
        dd      sector1         ; absolute # of starting sector
        dd      sector2         ; absolute # of last sector

 The master disk boot record invokes ROM BASIC if no indicator byte reflects a
bootable system.

 When a partition's boot record is given control, it is passed its partition
table entry address in the DS:SI registers.



DETERMINING HARD DISK ALLOCATION ...................................... 8**15

DOS determines disk allocation using the following formula:

                                         D * BPD
                            TS - RS -  �����������
                                           BPS
                      SPF = ������������������������������
                                        BPS * SPC
                                 CF + ��������������
                                           BPC
where:

     TS      Total number of sectors on the disk
     RS      The number of sectors at the beginning of the disk that are
             reserved for the boot record. DOS normally reserves 1 sector.
     D       The number of directory entries in the root directory.
     BPD     The number of bytes per directory entry. This is always 32.
     BPS     The number of bytes per logical sector. Typically 512, but you can
             specify a different number with VDISK.
     CF      The number of FATS per disk. Usually 2. VDISK is 1.
     SPF     The number of sectors per FAT. Maximum 64.
     SPC     The number of sectors per allocation unit (cluster).
     BPC     The number of bytes per FAT entry. BPC is 1.5 for 12 bit FATs.
             2 for 16 bit FATS.


To calculate the minimum partition size that will force a 16-bit FAT:

        CYL = (max clusters * 8)/(HEADS * SPT)

where:
     CYL           number of cylinders on the disk
     max clusters  4092 (maximum number of clusters for a 12 bit FAT)
     HEADS         number of heads on the hard disk
     SPT           sectors per track  (normally 17 on MFM)


 DOS 2.0 through 3.3 limit partition sizes to 32 megabytes. The limit arises
from the fact that DOS does things by sector number, and each sector is stored
as a word. So the largest sector number DOS can count to is 64k. As each
sector is 512 bytes long, 64k * .5k = 32Mb. The easiest way for an aftermarket
disk handler to break the 32Mb barrier is probably to increase the sector size
- with 2k sectors, maximum partiton size increases to 128Mb. However, the BIOS
boot routines and IBMBIO.COM are hardwired for 512 byte sectors, so you won't
be able to boot from a drive with oversize sectors. That's why Disk Manager
formats a small boot partition by default.

 DOS 2.x uses a "first fit" algorithm when allocating file space on the hard
disk. Each time an application requests disk space, it will scan from the
beginning of the FAT until it finds a contiguous peice of storage large enough
for the file.

 DOS 3.x+ keeps a pointer into the disk space, and begins its search from the
point it last left off. This pointer is lost when the system is rebooted.
This is called the "next fit" algorithm. It is faster than the first fit and
helps minimize fragmentation.

 In either case, if the FCB function calls are used instead of the handle
function calls, the file will be broken into pieces starting with the first
available space on the disk.

note 1) For hard disks, error code 11h (ECC data error) indicates that a
        recoverable error was detected during a preceding int 13h fn 02h
        (Read Sector) call.


Function 02h    Read Sectors - read one or more sectors from diskette
entry   AH      02h
        AL      number of sectors to read
        BX      address of buffer (ES=segment)
        CH      track (cylinder) number (0-39 or 0-79 for floppies)
                (for hard disk, bits 8,9 in high bits of CL)
        CL      sector number (1 to 18, not value checked)
        DH      head number (0 or 1)

       [0000:0078]  dword pointer to diskette parameters
return  CF      clear   successful
                        AL      number of sectors transferred

                                         0Ah, 20h, 40h, 80h)
note 1) Number of sectors begins with 1, not 0.
     2) Trying to read zero sectors is considered a programming error; results
        are not defined.
     3) For hard disks, the upper 2 bits of the 10-bit cylinder number are
        placed in the upper 2 bits of register CL.
     4) For hard disks, error code 11h indicates that a read error occurred
        that was corrected by the ECC algorithm; in this case, AL contains the
        burst length. The data read is good within the limits of the ECC code.
        If a multisector transfer was requested, the operation was terminated
        after the sector containing the read error.
     5) For floppy drives, an error may result from the drive motor being off
        at the time of the request. The BIOS does not automatically wait for
        the drive to come up to speed before attempting the read operation. The
        calling program should reset the floppy disk system with function 00h
        and retry the operation three times before assuming that the error
        results from some other cause.


Function 03h    Write Sectors - write from memory to disk
entry   AH      03h
        AL      number of sectors to write (1-8)
        CH      track number (for hard disk, bits 8,9 in high bits of CL)
        CL      beginning sector number

                set     error
                        AH      status (see 01h above)
note 1) Number of sectors begins with 1, not 0.
     2) Trying to write zero sectors is considered a programming error; results
        are not defined.
     3) For hard disks, the upper 2 bits of the 10-bit cylinder number are
        placed in the upper 2 bits of register CL.
     4) For floppy drives, an error may result from the drive motor being off
        at the time of the request. The BIOS does not automatically wait for
        the drive to come up to speed before attempting the read operation. The
        calling program should reset the floppy disk system with function 00h
        and retry the operation three times before assuming that the error
        results from some other cause.


Function 04h    Verify - verify that a write operation was successful
entry   AH      04h
        AL      number of sectors to verify (1-8)
        CH      track number  (for hard disk, bits 8,9 in high bits of CL)
        CL      beginning sector number
        DH      head number
        DL      drive number (0-7)
        DL      drive number (0-7)
                00h-7Fh   floppy disk
                80h-FF0h  hard disk
        ES:BX   address of buffer for data
return  CF      set on error
                AH      status (see 01h above)
        AL      number of sectors verified
note 1) With IBM PC, XT, and AT with ROM BIOS earlier than 11/15/85, ES:BX
        should point to a valid buffer.
     2) For hard disks, the upper 2 bits of the 10-bit cylinder number are
        placed in the upper 2 bits of register CL.
     3) This function can be used to test whether a readable media is in a
        floppy drive. An error may result from the drive motor being off at the
        time of the request since the BIOS does not automatically wait for the
        drive to come up to speed before attempting the verify operation. The
        requesting program should reset the floppy disk system with function
        00h and retry the operation three times before assuming that a readable
        disk is not present.


Function 05h    Format Track - write sector ID bytes for 1 track (floppy disk)
entry   AH      05h
        AL      number of sectors to create on this track
                interleave (for XT hard disk only)
        CH      track (or cylinder) number (bits 8,9 in high bits of CL)
        CL      sector number
        DH      head number (0, 1)
        DL      drive number (0-3)
                00h-7Fh   floppy disk
                80h-0FFh  hard disk
        ES:BX   pointer to 4-byte address field (C-H-R-N) (except XT hard disk)
                byte 1 = (C) cylinder or track
                byte 2 = (H) head
                byte 3 = (R) sector
                byte 4 = (N) bytes/sector (0 = 128, 1 = 256, 2 = 512, 3 = 1024)
return  CF      set if error occurred
                AH      status code (see 01h above)
note 1) Not valid for ESDI hard disks on PS/2.
     2) For floppy disks, the number of sectors per track is taken from the
        BIOS floppy disk parameter table whose address is stored in the vector
        for int 1Eh.
     3) When this function is used for floppies on ATs or the PS/2, it should
        be preceded by a call to int 13h/fn 17h to select the type of media to
        format.
     4) For hard disks, the upper 2 bits of the 10-bit cylinder number are
        placed in the upper 2 bits of CL.
     5) On the XT/286, AT, and PS/2 hard disks, ES:BX points to a 512-byte
        buffer containing byte pairs for each physical disk sector as follows:
        Byte  Contents
        0       00h     good sector
                80h     bad sector
        1       sector number
        For example, to format a track with 17 sectors and an interleave of
        two, ES:BX would point to the following 34-byte array at the beginning
        of a 512-byte buffer:
        db      00h, 01h, 00h, 0Ah, 00h, 02h, 00h, 0Bh, 00h, 03h, 00h, 0Ch

DEVICE DRIVER FORMAT�����������������������������������������������������������

 A device driver is a handler for communication between the system software
and hardware devices. The motherboard ROM and IBMBIO.COM or IO.SYS files
contain the basic drivers for allowing DOS to talk to the console, disk drives,
serial and parallel ports, clock, and other resources.

 DOS has five builtin drivers, STDIN, STDOUT, STERR, STDPRN, or STDAUX. An
"installable" driver may be loaded in the CONFIG.SYS file, and either replace
one of the builtin drivers or define a new resource, such as a mouse or
expanded memory driver.

 The device driver is a COM (memory image) file that contains all of the code
needed to control an add-in device. An EXE file should not be used since the
EXE loader in some DOS 2.x versions is part of COMMAND.COM, which is not
present when the device driver is being loaded by IBMBIO.COM or IO.SYS. EXE
format drivers could be used in DOS 3.x+, but there is generally no reason to
do so. The COM file must not load at the usual ORG 100h. Since the driver does
not use the Program Segment Prefix, it is simply loaded without offset,
therefore the driver file must have an origin of 0. Most references advise
"ORG 0 or no ORG statement", however with the advent of many new assemblers on
the market, some of which default to .COM files, specifically stating "ORG 0"
may eliminate problems. Driver files should not have a declared stack segment.

 DOS can install the device driver anywhere in memory, so care must be taken
in any FAR memory references. You should not expect that your driver will be
loaded in the same place every time.




TYPES OF DEVICES���������������������������������������������������������������

 There are two types of devices: Character devices and Block devices. Their
attributes are as follows:

 Character devices are designed to do serial I/O in a byte-by-byte manner.
These devices have names like CON, AUX, or PRN, and you can open channels
(handles or FCBs) to do I/O much like a disk file. I/O may be in either cooked
or raw mode. (see Chapter 7 for discussion of cooked and raw modes). Because
character devices have only one name, they can only support one device.

 Block devices are normally implemented as disk drives. They can do random I/O
in pieces called blocks, which are usually the physical sector size of the disk.
These devices are not named as character devices are, and cannot be opened
directly. Instead they are accessed by using drive letters such as A, B, C,
etc. Block devices can have units within them. In this way, a single block
driver can be responsible for one or more disk drives. For example, the first
block device driver can be responsible for drives A, B, C, and D. This means it
has four units defined and therefore takes up four drive letters. The position
of the driver in the chain of all drives determines the way in which the drive
letters correspond, i.e, if a second block device driver defines three units,
then those units are E, F, and G.

 DOS 1.x allows 16 block devices. DOS 2.x allows 63, and DOS 3.x allows 26. It
is recommended that drivers limit themselves to 26 devices for compatibility
with DOS 3.x and 4.x. When DOS 2.x passes the Z: drivespec, the drivespecs get
a little wierd, such as ^, [, or #. DOS 3.x+ will return an error message.




CREATING A DEVICE DRIVER�������������������������������������������������������

 To create a device driver that DOS can install, you must do the following:

1) Create a memory image (COM) file with a device header at the start of the
   file.
2) Originate the code (including the device header) at 0, instead of 100h.
3) Set the next device header field. Refer to "Pointer to Next Device Header
   Attribute Field" for more information.
4) Set the attribute field of the device header. Refer to "Attribute Field" for
   more information.
5) Set the entry points for the interrupt and strategy routines.
6) Fill in the name/unit field with the name of the character device or the
   unit number of the block device.

 DOS always processes installable character device drivers before handling the
default devices. So to install a new CON device, simply name the device CON.
Be sure to set the standard input device and standard output device bits in
the attribute field of a new CON device. The scan of the device list stops on
the first match so the installable device driver takes precedence. For
instance, installing ANSI.SYS replaces the builtin CON driver.

 DOS doesn't care about the position of installed character devices versus
block devices.




STRUCTURE OF A DEVICE DRIVER���������������������������������������������������

 A device driver consists of three major parts:
        a device header
        a strategy routine
        an interrupt routine


DEVICE HEADER

 The driver has a special header to identify it as a device and to define the
strategy and interrupt entry points and its various attributes. This header is
located at the beginning of the file. It contains a pointer to the next driver
in the chain, the attributes of the device, offsets into the strategy and
interrupt routines, and the device ID.

 This is the format of the device header:

������������������������������������������������������������������������������Ŀ
�                         D E V I C E    H E A D E R                           �

������������������������������������������������������������������������������Ĵ
�  0Ah  �8 bytes �  Name/Unit field                                            �
��������������������������������������������������������������������������������


POINTER TO NEXT DEVICE HEADER FIELD

 The device header field is a pointer to the device header of the next device
driver. It is a doubleword field that is set by DOS at the time the device
driver is loaded. The first word is the offset and the second word is the
segment.

 If you are loading only one device driver, set the device header field to -1
before loading the device. If you are loading more than one device driver, set
the first word of the device driver header to the offset of the next device
driver's header. Set the device driver header field of the last device driver
to -1.


ATTRIBUTE FIELD

 The attribute field is a word field used to identify the type of device this

character devices and determines is selected devices are given special

note 1) If a bit in the attribute word is defined only for one type of device,
        a driver for the other type of device must set that bit to 0.
     2) For DOS 2.0 bits 4-12 must be off.


BIT 1   is the standard input and output bit. It is used for character devices
        only. Use this bit to tell DOS if your character device driver is the
        new standard input device or standard output device.

BIT 2   is the NUL attribute bit. It is used for character devices only. Use it
        to tell DOS if your character device driver is a NUL device. Although
        there is a NUL device attribute bit, you cannot reassign the NUL
        device or replace it with your own routine. This attribute exists for
        DOS so that DOS can tell if the NUL device is being used.

BIT 3   is the clock device bit. It is used for character devices only. Default
        is 0. You can use it to tell DOS if your character device driver is the
        new CLOCK device.

BIT 4   is the "fast video output" bit. The default is 0, which uses the BIOS
        for writing to the screen. When set, this bit uses int 29h for much
        faster screen updates.

BITS 5-10  reserved for DOS, unknown. Should be set to 0.

BIT 11  is the open/close removeable media bit. Use it to tell DOS if the
        device driver can handle removeable media. This bit is valid for DOS
        3.0+ only. This bit was reserved in DOS 2.x. Since DOS 2.x does not
        look at this bit, its use is backward compatible.

BIT 12  reserved for DOS, unknown. Should be set to 0.

BIT 13  is the non-IBM format bit. When used for block devices it affects the
        operation of the BUILD BPB (BIOS parameter block) device call. For
        character devices it indicates that the devices implements the OUTPUT
        UNTIL BUSY device call.

BIT 14  is the IOCTL bit. It is used for both character and block devices. Use
        it to tell DOS whether the device driver can handle control strings
        through the IOCTL function call 44h.
         If a device driver cannot process control strings, it should set bit
        14 to 0. This way DOS can return an error if an attempt is made through
        the IOCTL function call to send or receive control strings to the
        device. If a device can process control strings, it should set bit 14
        to 1. This way, DOS makes calls to the IOCTL input and output device
        function to send and receive IOCTL strings.
         The IOCTL functions allow data to be sent to and from the device
        without actually doing a normal read or write. In this way, the device
        driver can use the data for its own use, (for example, setting a baud
        rate or stop bits, changing form lengths, etc.) It is up to the device
        to interpret the information that is passed to it, but the information
        must not be treated as a normal I/O request.

BIT 15  is the device type bit. Use it to tell the system the that driver is a
        block or character device.


POINTER TO STRATEGY ROUTINE

 This field contains a pointer to "device strategy" function in the driver.
This function is called whenever a request is made to the driver, and must
store the location of the request header from DOS. This pointer is a word
value, and so must be in the same segment as the device header.


POINTER TO INTERRUPT ROUTINE

 This field contains a pointer to the function which activates driver routines
to perform the command in the current request header. This is called by DOS
after the call to the strategy function, and should reset to the request header
address stored by "strategy", to allow for the possibility of interrupts
between the two calls. This pointer is a word value, and so must be in the same
segment as the device header.


NAME/UNIT FIELD

 This is an 8-byte field that contains the name of a character device or the
number of units in a block device. For the character names, the name is
left-justified and the space is filled to 8 bytes. For block devices, the
number of units can be placed in the first byte. This is optional because DOS
fills in this location with the value returned by the driver's INIT code. The
other 7 bytes of the block device ID are reserved and should not be used.



INSTALLING DEVICE DRIVERS������������������������������������������������������

 DOS installs new device drivers dynamically at boot time by reading and
processing the DEVICE command in the CONFIG.SYS file. For example, if you have
written a device driver called RAMDISK, to install it put this command in the
CONFIG.SYS file:
                   DEVICE=[drive][path] RAMDISK [parameters]

 DOS makes a FAR call to the device driver at its strategy entry point first,
using the request header to pass information describing what DOS wants the
device driver to do.

 This strategy routine does not perform the request but rather queues the
request or saves a pointer to the request header. The second entry point is
the interrupt routine and is called by DOS immediately after the strategy
routine returns. The interrupt routine is called with no parameters. Its
function is to perform the operation based on the queued request and set up
any return infromation.

 DOS passes the pointer to the request header in ES:BX. This structure consists
of a fixed length header (Request Header) followed by data pertinent to the
operation to be performed.

NOTE: It is the responsibility of the device driver to preserve the machine
      state. For example, save all registers on entry and restore them on exit.

 The stack used by DOS has enough room on it to save all the registers. If more
stack space is needed, it is the device driver's responsibility to allocate and
maintain another stack.

 All calls to execute device drivers are FAR calls. FAR returns should be
executed to return to DOS.



INSTALLING CHARACTER DEVICES

  One of the functions defined for each device is INIT. This routine is called
only once when the device is installed and never again. The INIT routine returns
the following:

A) A location to the first free byte of memory after the device driver, like a
   TSR that is stored in the terminating address field. This way, the
   initialization code can be used once and then thrown away to save space.
B) After setting the address field, a character device driver can set the status
   word and return.



INSTALLING BLOCK DEVICES

 Block devices are installed in the same way as character devices. The
difference is that block devices return additional information. Block devices
must also return:

A) The number of units in the block device. This number determines the logical
   names the devices will have. For example, if the current logical device
   letter is F at the time of the install call, and the block device driver INIT
   routine returns three logical units, the letters G, H, and I are assigned to
   the units. The mapping is determined by the position of the driver in the
   device list and the number of units in the device. The number of units
   returned by INIT overrides the value in the name/unit field of the device
   header.

B) A pointer to a BPB (BIOS Parameter Block) pointer array. This is a pointer
   to an array of "N" word pointers there "N" is the number of units defined.
   These word pointers point to BPBs. This way, if all of the units are the
   same, the entire array can point to the same BPB to save space.
    The BPB contains information pertinent to the devices such as the sector
   size, number of sectors per allocation unit, and so forth. The sector size of
   the BPB cannot be greater than the maximum allotted size set at DOS
   initialization time. This array must be protected below the free pointer set
    by the return.

C) The media descriptor byte. This byte is passed to devices so that they know
   what parameters DOS is currently using for a particular drive unit.

 Block devices can take several approaches. They can be "dumb" or "smart". A
dumb device would define a unit (and therefore a BPB) for each possible media
drive combination. Unit 0=drive 0;single side, unit 1=drive 0;double side, etc.
For this approach, the media descriptor bytes would mean nothing. A smart
device would allow multiple media per unit. In this case, the BPB table
returned at INIT must define space large enough to acommodate the largest
possible medias supported (sector size in BPB must be as large as maximum
sector size DOS is currently using). Smart drivers will use the media
descriptor byte to pass information about what media is currently in a unit.



REQUEST HEADER�����������������������������������������������������������������

 The request header passes the information describing what DOS wants the
device driver to do.
 When a valid device driver command code or function is called by your
application program, DOS develops a data structure called the "Request Header"
in ES:BX and passes it to the strategy entry point. This structure consists of
a 13-byte defined header which may be followed by other data bytes depending on
the function requested.
 It is the device driver's responsibility to preserve the machine state, for
example, saving all registers including flags on entry and restoring them on
exit. There is enough room on the stack when strategy or interrupt is called
to do about 20 pushes. If more stack is needed, the driver should set aside
its own stack space.
 The fixed ("static") part of the request header is as follows:

����������������������������������������������������������������������������Ŀ

REQUEST HEADER LENGTH FIELD

 The length in bytes of the total request header (0-255) plus any data at the
end of the header.


UNIT CODE FIELD

 The unit code field identifies which unit in a block device driver the request
is for. For example, if a block device driver has three units defined, then the
possible values of the unit code field would be 0, 1, and 2. This field is not
valid for character devices.


COMMAND CODE FIELD

 The command code invokes a specific device driver function. Functions 0
through 12 are supported in all device drivers. Functions 13-15 are available
only in DOS 3.0 or higher. Some functions are relevant for either character or
block devices but not both; nonetheless all functions must have an executable
routine present even if it does nothing but set the done flag in the return
status word in the request header.

 The command code field in the request header can have the following values:
������������������������������������������������������������������������������Ŀ
� code �       name       �                     function                       �

 The low 8 bits of the status word define an error message if bit 15 is set.
These errors are:

        00h  write protect violation   01h  unknown unit
        02h  device not ready          03h  unknown command
        04h  CRC error                 05h  bad drive request structure length
        06h  seek error                07h  unknown media
        08h  sector not found          09h  printer out of paper
        0Ah  write fault               0Bh  read fault

        0Eh  reserved                  0Fh  invalid disk change

BIT 8   is the done bit. If it is set, it means the operation is complete. The
        driver sets the bit to 1 when it exits.

BIT 9   is the busy bit. It is only set by status calls and the removable media
        call.

BITS 10-14 are reserved.

BIT 15  is the error bit. If this bit is set, the low 8 bits of the status word
        (7-0) indicate the error code.


RESERVED FOR DOS
 Official sources label this area as "reserved for DOS". Another source
indicates that this consists of two double-word (4-byte) pointers to be used
to maintain a linked list of request headers for this device and a list of all
current device requests being processed by DOS. This was apparently to be used
for the undelivered multitasking version of DOS.



DEVICE DRIVER FUNCTIONS��������������������������������������������������������

 All strategy routines are called with ES:BX pointing to the request header.
The interrupt routines get the pointers to the request header from the queue
the strategy routines stores them in. The command code in the request header
tells the driver which function to perform.

NOTE: All DWORD pointers are stored offset first, then segment.

                         ############################

INIT
Command code = 0        (all devices)
        Performs all initialization required at DOS boot time to install the
        driver and set local driver variables. This function is called only
        once, when the driver is loaded.

         11h       dword   ending address of the driver's resident code
         15h       dword   pointer to BPB array (not set by character devices)
                           /pointer to remainder of arguments
         19h       byte    drive number (DOS 3.0+ only)


 When INIT is called, the driver must do the following:

        A) set the number of units (block devices only)
        B) set up the pointer to the BPB array (block devices only)
        C) perform any initialization code (to modems, printers, etc)
        D) set the ending address of the resident program code
        E) set the status word in the request header

 To obtain information obtained from CONFIG.SYS to a device driver at INIT
time, the BPB pointer field points to a buffer containing the information
passed from CONFIG.SYS following the =. The buffer that DOS passes to the
driver at INIT after the file specification contains an ASCII string for the
file OPEN. The ASCII string (ending in 0h) is terminated by a carriage return
(0Dh) and linefeed (0Ah). If there is no parameter information after the file
specification, the file specification is immediately followed by a linefeed
(0Ah).

 NOTE: This information is read-only and only system calls 01h-0Ch and 30h can
       be issued by the INIT code of the driver.

 The last byte parameter contains the drive letter for the first unit of a
block driver. For example, 0=A, 1=B etc.

 If an INIT routine determines that it cannot set up the device and wants to
abort without using any memory, follow this procedure:

        A) set the number of units to 0
        B) set the ending offset address at 0
        C) set the ending offsret segment address to the code segment (CS)

NOTE: If there are multiple device drivers in a single memory image file, the
      ending address returned by the last INIT called is the one DOS uses. It is
      recommended that all device drivers in a single memory image file return
      the same ending address.

MEDIA CHECK
command code = 1        (block devices only)
        Checks to see if disk had been changed since last access.

        ES:BX   pointer to 19-byte request header and data structure
 Format of structure:
        offset  length          field
        00h     13 bytes   request header
        0Dh        byte    media descriptor from BPB
        0Eh        byte    returned
        0Fh       dword    returns a pointer to the previous volume ID (if bit
                           11=1 and disk change is returned) (DOS 3.0+)

 When the command code field is 1, DOS calls MEDIA CHECK for a drive unit and
passes its current media descriptor byte. See "Media Descriptor Byte" later in
this chapter for more information about the byte. MEDIA CHECK returns one of
the following:

        A) media not changed             C) not sure
        B) media changed                 D) error code

The driver must perform the following:
        A) set the status word in the request header
        B) set the return byte
                00h   don't know if media has been changed
                01h   media has not been changed
                -1    media has been changed

 DOS 3.0+: If the driver has set the removable media bit 11 of the device header
attribute word to 1 and the driver returns -1 (media changed), the driver must
set the DWORD pointer to the previous volume identification field. If DOS
determines that the media changed is an error, DOS generates an error 0Fh
(invalid disk change) on behalf of the device. If the driver does not implement
volume identification support, but has bit 11 set to 1, the driver should set a
pointer to the string "NO NAME",0.


MEDIA DESCRIPTOR
 Currently the media descriptor byte has been defined for a few media types.
This byte should be identical to the media byte if the device has the non-IBM
format bit off. These predetermined values are:

media descriptor byte =&gt;    1  1  1  1  1  0  0  0
 (numeric order)            7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0

       BIT                MEANING

        1       0       not 8 sector
                1       8 sector
        2       0       nonremoveable
                1       removeable
       3-7      must be set to 1

BUILD BPB (BIOS Parameter Block)
command code = 2        (block devices only)

        ES:BX   pointer to 22-byte request header and data structure
 Format of structure:
        offset   length          field
        00h     13 bytes   request header
        0Dh        byte    media descriptor from DOS
        0Eh       dword    transfer address (buffer address)
        12h       dword    pointer to BPB table

DOS calls BUILD BPB under the following two conditions:

A) If "media changed" is returned.
B) If "not sure" is returned. If so, there are no used buffers. Used buffers
   are buffers with changed data that have not yet been written to the disk.

The driver must do the following:

A) set the pointer to the BPB.
B) set the status word in the request header.

 The driver must determine the correct media type currently in the unit to
return the pointer to the BPB table. The way the buffer is used (pointer
passed by DOS) is determined by the non-IBM format bit in the attribute field
of the device header. If bit 13=0 (device is IBM compatible), the buffer
contains the first sector of the FAT (most importantly the FAT ID byte). The
driver must not alter this buffer in this case. If bit 13=1 the buffer is a
one sector scratch area which can be used for anything.

 For drivers that support volume identification and disk change, the call
should cause a new volume identification to be read off the disk. This call
indicates that the disk has been legally changed.

 If the device is IBM compatible, it must be true that the first sector of the
first FAT is located at the same sector for all possible media. This is
because the FAT sector is read before the media is actually determined.

 The information relating to the BPB for a particular media is kept in the boot
sector for the media. In particular, the format of the boot sector is:

 The three words at the end return information about the media. The number of
heads is useful for supporting different multihead drives that have the same
storage capacity but a different number of surfaces. The number of hidden
sectors is useful for drive partitioning schemes.

                             0Fh is returned

The driver must perform the following:
        A) set the status word in the request header
        B) perform the requested function
        C) set the actual number of sectors or bytes tranferred

 No error checking is performed on an IOCTL I/O call. However, the driver must
set the return sector or byte count to the actual number of bytes transferred.

 Under certain circumstances a block device driver may be asked to do a write
operation of 64k bytes that seems to be a "wrap around" of the transfer address
in the BIOS I/O packet. This arises due to an optimization added to write code
in DOS. It will only happen in writes that are within a sector size of 64k on
files that are being extended past the current end of file. It is allowable for
the device driver to ignore the balance of the write that wraps around, if it
so chooses. For example, a write of 10000h bytes worth of sectors with a
transfer address of XXX:1 ignores the last two bytes. A user program can never
request an I/O of more than 0FFFFh bytes and cannot wrap around (even to 0) in
the transfer segment, so in that case the last two bytes can be ignored.

 A program that uses DOS function calls can never request an input or output
function of more than 0FFFFh bytes, therefore, a wrap around in the transfer
(buffer) segment can never occur. It is for this reason you can ignore bytes
that would have wrapped around in the tranfer segment.

 If the driver returns an error code of 0Fh (invalid disk change) it must put
a DWORD pointer to an ASCIIZ string which is the correct volume ID to ask the
user to reinsert the disk.

DOS 3.0+:
 The reference count of open files on the field (maintained by the OPEN and
CLOSE calls) allows the driver to determine when to return error 0Fh. If there
are no open files (reference count=0) and the disk has been changed, the I/O
is all right, and error 0Fh is not returned. If there are open files
(reference count &gt; 0) and the disk has been changed, an error 0Fh condition
may exist.

NONDESTRUCTIVE INPUT NO WAIT
command code = 5        (character devices only)
        Reads a character from input stream but does not remove it from the
        buffer

        ES:BX   pointer to 14-byte request header and data structure
 Format of structure:
        offset    length          field
        00h     13 bytes   request header
        0Dh        byte    read from device

The driver must do the following:
        A) return a byte from the device
        B) set the status word in the request header.

 If the character device returns busy bit=0 (characters in the buffer), then
the next character that would be read is returned. This character is not removed
form the buffer (hence the term nondestructive input). This call allows DOS to
look ahead one character.

                         ############################

STATUS
command codes =  6   Input Status      (character devices only)
                10   Output Status     (character devices only)
        Check for characters waiting in input buffer

        ES:BX   pointer to 13-byte request header

This driver must perform the following:
        A) perform the requested function
        B) set the busy bit
        C) set the status word in the request header.

The busy bit is set as follows:

 For input on unbuffered character devices: if the busy bit (bit 9) is 1 on
return, a write request would wait for completion of a current request. If the
busy bit is 0, there is no current request. Therefore, a write request would
start immediately.

 For input on buffered character devices: if the busy bit is 1 on return, a
read request does to the physical device. If the busy bit is 0, there are
characters in the device buffer and a read returns quickly. It also indicates
that a user has typed something. DOS assumes all character devices have a type-
ahead input buffer. Devices that do not have this buffer should always return
busy=0 so that DOS does not hang waiting for information to be put in a buffer
that does not exist.

                         ############################

FLUSH INPUT BUFFERS
command code = 7        (character devices only)
        Forces all data in buffers to specified device.

        ES:BX   pointer to 13-byte request header

 This call tells the driver to flush (terminate) all pending requests that it
has knowledge of. Its primary use is to flush the input queue on character
devices.

 The driver must set the status word in the request header upon return.

                         ############################

FLUSH OUTPUT BUFFERS
command code 11         (character devices only)
        Forces all data in buffers to specified device.

        ES:BX   pointer to 13-byte request header


 This call tells the driver to flush all output buffers and discards any
pending requests. Its primary use is to flush the output queue on character
devices.

 The driver must set the status word in the request header upon return.

                         ############################

OPEN or CLOSE  (DOS 3.0+)
command code = 13   Open      (block or character devices)
               14   Close     (block or character devices)

        ES:BX   pointer to 13-byte static request header

 These calls are designed to give the device information about the current file
activity on the device if bit 11 of the attribute word is set. On block
devices, these calls can be used to manage local buffering. The device can keep
a reference count. Every OPEN causes the device to increment the reference
count. Every CLOSE causes the device to decrement the reference count. When the
reference count is 0, if means there are no open files in the device. Therefore,
the device should flush buffers inside the device it has written to because now
the user can change the media on a removeable media drive. If the media had been
changed, it is advisable to reset the reference count to 0 without flushing the
buffers. This can be thought of as "last close causes flush". These calls are
more useful on character devices. The OPEN call can be used to send a device
initialization string. On a printer, this could cause a string to be sent to set
the font, page size, etc. so that the printer would always be in a known state
in the I/O stream. Similarly, a CLOSE call can be used to send a post string
(like a form feed) at the end of an I/O stream. Using IOCTL to set these pre and
post strings provides a flexible mechanism of serial I/O device stream control.

 Since all processes have access to STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR, STDAUX, and STDPRN
(handles 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4) the CON, AUX, and PRN devices are always open.

                         ############################

REMOVABLE MEDIA  (DOS 3.0+)
command code = 15       (block devices only)
        This call identifies the media type as removable or nonremovable.

        ES:BX   pointer to 13-byte static request header

 To use this call, set bit 11 (removable media) of the attribute field to 1.
Block devices can only use this call through a subfunction of the IOCTL
function call (int 21h fn44h).
 This call is useful because it allows a utility to know whether it is dealing
with a nonremovable media drive or with a removable media drive. For example,
the FORMAT utility needs to know whether a drive is removable or nonremovable
because it prints different versions of some prompts.

note    No error checking is performed. It is assumed that this call always
        succeeds.


THE CLOCK$ DEVICE��������������������������������������������������������������

 To allow a clock board to be integrated into the system for TIME and DATE,
the CLOCK$ device is used. This device defines and performs functions like any
other character device (most functions will be reset done bit, reset error bit,
and return). When a read or write to this device occurs, 6 bytes are
transferred. The first 2 bytes are a word, which is the count of days since
01-01-80. The third byte is minutes, the fourth is hours, the fifth is
hundredths of a second, and the sixth is seconds.

 Reading the CLOCK$ device gets the date and time, writing to it sets the date
and time. CLOCK$ is normally called only when the system is initializing or if
the system time and date are set (DOS 3.3+). DOS carries the system time and
date internally after receiving it from the CLOCK$ driver.

 The information presented here was gathered from megabytes of files found on
BBS systems, conversations on a dozen different BBS systems, correspondence,
and every reference book I could get my hands on. On occasion, a number of
prestigious references didn't agree with each other. Where this has happened, I
have used the latest references. There is too much information here for me to
verify every fact personally. I have used my own judgement as to the
reliability of the sources.

 I've been selling copies of the Reference since October 1987.  The original
basis for the Reference came from Peter Norton's "Programmer's Guide to the
IBM PC" and the original Janet Jack interrupt list circa sometime 1986, as
updated by Ross Greenberg. Anyway, I've prepared a list of the sources I've
used for the Reference to clear up any ambiguities.



Tools used in preparing this book:


Microsoft SymDeb, the final gasp of venerable DEBUG.COM and a fine program.

Microsoft CodeView, huge and awkward though it may be.

V Communications Sourcer, the only effective disassembler I've found.

Novell SFT System Administrator's Reference

***************************

 Western Digital, Rodime, Miniscribe, Microscience, Adaptec, Storage
Technologies, and Connor Peripherals were kind enough to send spec sheets on
most of their products which helped to expand and verify the hard drive
information in Appendix 6.

***************************

 A large amount of miscellaneous information came from various computer
magazines. Documenting what came from where would be an experience all its
own. A great deal of information came from articles by Michael Mefford and
Charles Petzold of PC Magazine, and Neil Rubenking, Jeff Duntemann, and
Ray Duncan, who get around a lot.

   Byte
        ( Byte's kinda weird. They have some really neat, well-researched
          stuff interspersed with mindless drivel.  Still, they print some
          stuff you absolutely, positively won't find anywhere else. )

   C'T (Computer Technik)
        ( If you read German, this one is sorta like PC Magazine was in its
          heyday. )

   Computer Language
        ( I never decided if I liked CL or not.  Maybe I'm not the sort of
          programmer they're writing for... )

   Computer Shopper
        ( Though primarily advertising, some information sneaks in from time
          to time. )

   Dr. Dobb's Journal
        ( I always thought the old title, "Doctor Dobbs' Journal of Computer
          Calisthenics and Orthodontia - Running Light Without Overbyte" was
          a killer name, but nobody asked me. )

   InfoWorld
        ( I never really figured out how a weekly magazine could so often be
          both late *and* wrong with their stories, but IW tries hard. Still,
          you often hear about rumblings you'd never find out about in the
          slicks. The National Enquirer of the computer world? )

   Micro Cornucopia
        ( R.I.P - it was great while it lasted. )

   Microsoft Systems Journal
        ( Hideously expensive and mostly oriented to Windows and OS/2, the
          early issues had some really good stuff )

   Midnight Engineering
        ( This one's hard to classify.  It's hardcore computer with a dash
          of entrepreneurship, bizarre as the combination may sound.  I like
          it when I can find it. )

   PC Magazine
        ( Despite their new "management format" in mid '89, PC Mag still has
          some good techie stuff from time to time. I guess the bean counters
          thought managers were more important than programmers. )

   PC Resource
        ( There was rarely anything of interest in PC Resource, but every
          now and then I found something. Now defunct. )

   PC Tech Journal
        ( "Tell 'em what you're going to say, tell 'em what you're saying, tell
          'em what you just said." - and don't send us no steenking submissions
          unless they're in WordPerfect format! Despite their fascist policies,
          every now and then they printed something useful. The Little Rock
          Wild Bunch refered to it as "PC Tech Urinal," an apt monicker. Now
          defunct. )

   PC Techniques
        ( This is the magazine PC Tech Journal tried to advertise itself as.
          Pure programming, written by programmers for programmers, without
          too many "journalists" pissing in the text. Try it! )

   Programmer's Journal
        ( This is a nice magazine, though expensive. )

   Tech Specialist
        ( One of the few really good magazines for bit-twiddlers.  Haven't
          seen a GUI phone-dialer shootout yet! )

DOSREF isn't a tutorial, and sometimes you need a tutorial.  Microsoft has 
finally written a half-decent one - The MS-DOS Programmer's Reference,
Microsoft Press, 1991, ISBN 1-55615-329-5.  This is the DOS 5.0 Tech Ref.
It covers data structures and DOS programming concepts clearly.  However,
it has no information on other DOS versions, nor does it (of course) cover 
undocumented calls.

                     ------------------------------------

 Nothing gets written in a vacuum, and I'd like to express my thanks to all
the people who have been good enough to furnish information and support:
   (in alphabetical order)

Tommy Apple, Mike Crawford, Herman Diagostino, Joe Felix, Ron Melson,
Denis Murphy, &amp; Ben Sansing,

 Special thanks to Chris Dunford, who donated his "CED" program to the public
domain. If it wasn't for CED, I would likely have abandoned MSDOS machines
entirely and bought a Macin...uh... something else; and to Haruyasu Yoshizaki
for allowing unrestricted use of his LHarc program used to compress the files
on these diskettes.

Intel iAPX 286 Programmer's Reference Manual, including the iAPX 286
Numeric Supplement, Intel part no. 210498-003.  Has some reasonably useful
example codes in section 4, including ASCII to binary and vice versa on
pages 4-7 to 4-14 and trig functions on 4-18 to 4-23.  The programming
style in these examples is rather bizarre but they are better than nothing.

Intel 80387 Programmer's Reference Manual,  Intel part no. 231917-001.
Various example listings on pages 7-7 to 7-17, including ASCII to binary
and binary to ASCII conversions and raising a number to a power.  No trig
routines in this manual because the 80387 has built-in FSIN, FCOS, and FSINCOS
instructions and generalized FPTAN and FPATAN instructions that make
subroutines  unnecessary.
