                             BUFFERS
                             -------

This unit implements a simple movable memory manager, primarily 
for use with the EDITORS unit. This unit sets aside a fixed
amount of memory to manage at the end of the normal heap, the
size of which is determined by BufHeapSize (in paragraphs).
Memory is allocated through calls to NewBuffer and SetBufferSize.
The advantage to movable memory managers is no memory is wasted
due to fragmentation since the memory can move. Unfortunately,
unless great care is taken, only one pointer to this memory can
exist.

As with most movable memory managers, BUFFERS allocates the
memory to what is referred to as a master pointer. The master
pointer is kept up-to-date as to the current location of the
buffer and is modified whenever the memory is moved. It is
assumed that this pointer, the pointer passed to the NewBuffer
procedure, is the only pointer that is pointing to the memory. If
a copy is made, either through an assignment or if the pointer is
passed as a parameter, the copy will not be updated. Typically
when a copy is necessary a pointer to the master pointer is used
instead. For example

  CopyPtr = @MstrPtr;

When the copy is used, it is dereferenced twice, as in

  CopyPtr^^ := {Some value};

so that all references to the memory allocated go through the
master pointer. Note, since very few allocations can meet these
requirements, this unit is not intended to replace Turbo Pascal's
heap manager for general heap allocation needs.

Care should be taken when using pointers allocated with BUFFERS.
It is bad practice to assume that a copy of the master pointer is
valid. Such assumptions can lead to sporadic and very difficult-
to-reproduce bugs. Typically, only the master pointer itself is 
ever used, as is done in EDITORS.

BUFFERS is a simple movable memory manager in that it does not
try to minimize the movement of buffers when a buffer is
deallocated or resized. Buffers are positioned in the buffer area
in the order they are allocated. When a buffer is resized, the
buffers above it are moved up or down to accommodate the change.
Since this movement takes time, it is assumed that the user of
this unit will take great pains to minimize the resizing of
buffers.


                            Variables
                            ---------

BufHeapSize: Word = 0;

  The amount of memory, in paragraphs, to be managed by this
  unit. This variable must be set before calling InitBuffers.

BufHeapPtr: Word = 0;

  The segment marking the beginning of buffer memory.

BufHeapEnd: Word = 0;

  The segment marking the end of buffer memory.


                    Procedures and Functions
                    ------------------------

procedure InitBuffers;

  Allocates a block of memory from the end of the heap to be used
  for buffers. The size of this block is determined by the value
  of BufHeapSize (in paragraphs) when this routine is called.

procedure DoneBuffers;

  Returns to the heap the memory allocated by InitBuffers.

procedure NewBuffer(var P: Pointer);

  Allocates a buffer to the given pointer. The given pointer
  becomes the master pointer to the allocated buffer and a
  reference to the pointer's location is stored. The pointer will
  be updated whenever the position of the buffer changes. The
  buffer size is initially zero an can be adjusted by a call to
  SetBufferSize. If a buffer is deallocated, or the size of a
  buffer changes, the position of all the buffers allocated after
  this one change. Each buffer has an overhead of 16 bytes (one
  paragraph) which is used to store the size of the buffer and
  the location of its master pointer.

procedure DisposeBuffer(P: Pointer);

  Deallocates the buffer allocated to the given pointer. The memory
  allocated can now be used by other buffers. This pointer must
  point to a buffer allocated with a call to NewBuffer. Disposing
  of a buffer will cause the master pointer of all buffers allocated
  after this buffer to change.

function GetBufferSize(P: Pointer): Word;

  Returns the size of the buffer allocated to this pointer. This
  pointer must be a pointer allocated with NewBuffer.

function SetBufferSize(P: Pointer; Size: Word): Boolean;

  Increases or decreases the size of the given buffer. This
  pointer must have been allocated with NewBuffer. Changing the 
  size of a buffer will cause the master pointer of buffers
  allocated after this one to change.
