                             -------

TEditor implements a small, fast 64K editor for use in Turbo
Vision applications. It features mouse support, undo, clipboard
cut, copy and paste, autoindent and overwrite modes, WordStar
key bindings, and search and replace. This editor can be used not
only for editing files, but as a multi-line memo field in dialogs
or forms.

The use of TEditor is demonstrated in TVEDIT.PAS for editing
files and TVFORM.PAS as a memo field. Both of these file can be
found in the \T6\TVDEMOS directory.



                         Object summary
                         --------------

TEditor
-------
TEditor is the base object for all editors. It implements most of
the editor's functionality. If a TEditor object is created, it
will allocate its buffer out of the heap with the given size. The
buffer will initially be empty.

TMemo
-----
TMemo is a descendant of TEditor that is intended to go into a
dialog or form. It supports GetData and SetData and allows the Tab
key to be processed by TDialog. It also has a different palette
than TEditor. GetData/SetData expect a record like the following,

  TMemoRec = record
    TextLen: Word;
    TextData: array[1..MaxMemoLen] of Char;
   end;

where MaxMemoLen is the BufSize value passed to TMemo. TMemo
allocates its buffer from the heap.

TFileEditor
-----------
TFileEditor edits the contents of a file, which it stores in memory
allocated from the Buffers unit. This allows several editors to share
the same memory pool. Instead of allocating 64k for each editor, you
can allocate, say, 128k for all your editors. If the first editor only
takes up 16k, it will leave 112k for other editors. The editor takes
only the memory it needs at the time out of the pool. An editor will
grow by 4k at a time whenever the "gap" shrinks to 0, and will shrink
by 4k at a time if the gap grows larger than 4K. See below for a
description of the "gap." See BUFFERS.DOC for further information on
dynamic buffers.

TEditWindow
-----------
TEditWindow is a window designed to hold a TFileEditor or the
clipboard. It will change its title to display the file name
being edited and will initialize scroll bars and an indicator for
the editor. If the name passed to TEditWindow is blank, it
assumes that you are initializing the clipboard.

TIndicator
----------
TIndicator is the line and column counter in the lower left
corner of the edit window. It is initialized by TEditWindow and
passed as the fourth parameter to a TEditor.


                          Key Bindings
                          ------------

Keys are bound to many of the the familiar WordStar key bindings
used in the IDE. The only exceptions are the block commands. Since
TEditor does not use persistent blocks, the block commands are
simulated by copying the information to and from the clipboard.
For example, ^K^B will begin selecting text. ^K^K will copy the
text to the clipboard. ^K^C will paste the contents from the
clipboard to the editor. This simulates, quite closely, the
keystrokes to do the same thing using WordStar bindings.

The selection can be started by holding down the shift key with
any of the cursor movement commands instead of using the ^K
bindings.

These key bindings can be changed by overriding the ConvertEvent
method which translates the given key event to a command event.


                            Internals
                            ---------

Buffer structure
----------------
TEditor implements a "buffer gap" editor. It stores the text in
two pieces. Any text before the cursor is stored at the beginning
of the buffer, and text after the cursor is stored at the end
of the buffer. The space between the text is called the "gap."
When a character is inserted into the editor it is inserted into
the gap. The editor supports undo by recording deleted text in the
gap and maintaining the the number of characters inserted and
deleted. When asked to perform an undo, the characters that were
inserted are deleted, the deleted characters are copied to the
beginning of the gap, and the cursor is positioned after the
formerly-deleted text.

To illustrate how the buffer operates, consider the following
diagram of an editor buffer after the characters
"abcdefghijkxxxopqrstuvwxyz" are inserted,

                                      CurPtr
                                      |
                                      v<-- GapLen -->
           ===========================................
           |abcdefghijkxxxopqrstuvwxyz               |
           ===========================................
            <-------- BufLen -------->
            <---------------- BufSize -------------->

                   Buffer after text inserted

CurPtr records the position of the cursor, GapLen is the length
of the gap, and BufLen is the total number of characters in the
buffer. BufSize is the size of the buffer which is always the sum
of GapLen and BufLen. If the cursor is then moved to just after
the "xxx" characters, the buffer would look like,

                          CurPtr
                          |
                          v<-- GapLen -->
           ===============...............=============
           |abcdefghijkxxx               opqrstuvwxyz|
           ===============...............=============
  BufLen =  <------------>      +       <----------->
            <--------------- BufSize --------------->

                  Buffer after cursor movement

Note that the gap is kept in front of the cursor. This allow for
quick insertion of characters without moving any text. If "xxx"
is deleted using the backspace key the characters are copied to
the bottom of the gap and the cursor is moved backwards. The
DelCount field records the number of characters deleted.

                       CurPtr
                       |
                       v<--- GapLen ---->
           ============..................=============
           |abcdefghijk               xxxopqrstuvwxyz|
           ============..................=============
                                      <-> DelCount
  BufLen =  <------------>      +       <----------->
            <--------------- BufSize --------------->

                  Buffer after "xxx" is deleted

When characters are inserted, the insertion count, InsCount, is
incremented to record how to many characters to delete with an
undo. If "lmn" are now typed, the buffer would look like this:

                          CurPtr
                          |
                          v<-- GapLen -->
           ===============...............=============
           |abcdefghijklmn            xxxopqrstuvwxyz|
           ===============...............=============
                       <-> InsCount   <-> DelCount
  BufLen =  <------------>      +       <----------->
            <--------------- BufSize --------------->

                 Buffer after "lmn" is inserted

InsCount records the number of characters inserted. If an undo is
now requested "lmn" are deleted and "xxx" are copied on top of them,
restoring the buffer to what it was before the edits.

                          CurPtr
                          |
                          v<-- GapLen -->
           ===============...............=============
           |abcdefghijkxxx               opqrstuvwxyz|
           ===============...............=============
  BufLen =  <------------>      +       <----------->
            <--------------- BufSize --------------->

                        Buffer after undo


If the cursor is moved before the undo is performed, all undo
information is lost because the gap moves. Undo will only undo
operations done between cursor movements. As soon as the cursor
moves, the edits performed are considered "accepted."  Note also
that undo takes space inside the buffer which could prevent the
user from inserting text. The space can be recovered by moving
the cursor.

Selection or block
------------------
The Selection or block mark is always either before or after the
cursor. If text is inserted into the editor, either through a key
press, or through InsertText, the contents of the selection are
replaced by the inserted text. If there is no selection, the text
is just inserted. The selection is marked by the fields SelStart
and SelEnd. The selection can be set by the call SetSelection,
which will also move the cursor.

Options
-------
TEditor provides several options, the state of which are stored in
Boolean fields. CanUndo indicates whether the editor records undo
information. Since undo takes space temporarily from inserts, you
might find it advantageous to disable undo. This is done
automatically for the clipboard. Overwrite indicates whether the
editor is in overwrite or insert mode. AutoIndent records whether
the editor will, when the Enter key is pressed, indent the cursor
to the column of the first non-space character of the previous
line. This is convenient if the editor is used to edit source
code.

Methods
-------
constructor Init(var Bounds: TRect; AHScrollBar, AVScrollBar: PScrollBar;
  AIndicator: PIndicator; ABufSize: Word);

  Creates a TEditor object with the given scroll bars and indicator,
  and with a buffer of size ABufSize. Options are set to
  sfSelectable and the EventMask additionally allows handling of
  broadcast events. Any of AHScrollBar, AVScrollBar or
  AIndicator can be nil if you do not want to use them.

constructor Load(var S: TStream);

  Creates and initializes a TEditor object off the given stream.
  It does not load the previous contents of the buffer, but
  instead initializes the buffer to empty.

function BufChar(P: Word): Char;

  Returns the P'th character in the file, factoring in the gap.

function BufPtr(P: Word): Word;

  Returns the offset into Buffer of the P'th character in the
  file, factoring in the gap.

procedure ChangeBounds(var Bounds: TRect); virtual;

  Overridden to ensure the file stays within view if the parent
  size changes.

procedure ConvertEvent(var Event: TEvent); virtual;

  Converts key events into command events. Used to implement the
  WordStar key-bindings. Override if you wish to change or
  extend the default key-bindings.

function CursorVisible: Boolean;

  Returns true if the cursor (or insertion point) is visible
  within the view.

procedure DeleteSelect;

  Deletes selection if one exists.

procedure DoneBuffer; virtual;

  Called whenever the buffer should be disposed. By default it
  calls FreeMem with Buffer and BufSize. It should be overridden
  if you wish not to use the heap to store the buffer. This is
  done in TFileEditor.

procedure Draw; virtual;

  Overridden to draw the editor. This should not be overridden
  by descendants of TEditor.

function GetPalette: PPalette; virtual;

  Returns the Editor palette, CEditor. Override if you wish to
  change the palette of the editor.

procedure HandleEvent(var Event: TEvent); virtual;

  Provides the event handling for the editor. Override if you
  wish to extend the commands the editor handles.

procedure InitBuffer; virtual;

  Called whenever the buffer should be allocated. By default, an
  editor will call GetMem with Buffer and BufSize. You should
  override this method if you do not want the editor to allocate
  the buffer from the heap.

function InsertBuffer(var P: PEditBuffer; Offset, Length: Word;
  AllowUndo, SelectText: Boolean): Boolean;

  This is the lowest-level text insertion method. It will
  insert Length bytes of text from the given pointer to text into
  the buffer from the given offset into the buffer, P. It will
  optionally record undo information and select the text
  inserted. This method need never be called directly, since it
  is called from InsertFrom and InsertText. This method should
  be used if the buffer to be copied from could move (e.g., P was
  allocated using the Buffers unit).

function InsertFrom(Editor: PEditor): Boolean; virtual;

  Insert the selection from the given editor into this editor.
  This method is used to implement Cut, Copy, and Paste. It need
  never be overridden by the user.

function InsertText(Text: Pointer; Length: Word;
  SelectText: Boolean): Boolean;

  Insert the given text of length Length into the buffer,
  optionally selecting the text. This is an easier-to-use
  version of InsertBuffer.

procedure ScrollTo(X, Y: Integer);

  Move column X and line Y to the upper-left corner of the editor.

function Search(FindStr: String; Opts: Word): Boolean;

  Search for the given string in the editor with the given
  options. The options words are,

    efCaseSensitive      Case sensitive search
    efWholeWordsOnly     Find whole words only


function SetBufSize(NewSize: Word): Boolean; virtual;

  Called whenever the buffer can be grown or shrunk to the given
  value. It should return true if the the buffer can be of the
  given size. By default, it returns true if NewSize is less than
  or equal to the new size.

procedure SetCmdState(Command: Word; Enable: Boolean);

  Disables or enables the given command. The command is always
  disabled if the editor is not the selected view. Used as a
  convenient way to enable and disable command instead of using
  EnableCommands and DisableCommands.

procedure SetSelect(NewStart, NewEnd: Word; CurStart: Boolean);

  Set the selection to the given offsets into the file. This
  method will either place the cursor in front of behind the
  selection pending on the value of CurStart.

procedure SetState(AState: Word; Enable: Boolean); virtual;

  SetState is overridden to hide and show scroll bars and the
  indicator and to enable and disable commands. If you wish to
  enable and disable additional commands, override UpdateCommands
  instead. This is called whenever the command states should be
  updated.

procedure Store(var S: TStream);

  Stores the editor on the given stream.

procedure TrackCursor(Center: Boolean);

  Forces the cursor to be visible. If Center is True, the
  cursor is forced to be in the center of the screen in the Y
  access. The X, or column, is not changed.

procedure Undo;

  Undo the changes since the last cursor movement.

procedure UpdateCommands; virtual;

  Called whenever the commands should be updated. This is used
  to enable and disable commands such as cmUndo, cmClip, cmCopy,
  etc.

function Valid(Command: Word): Boolean; virtual;

  Returns whether the view is valid given Command. By default it
  returns the value of IsValid which is True if Buffer is non-nil.

  .BAK file is created. Will call SaveAs if the editor is
  "Untitled."

function SaveAs: Boolean;

  Saves the editor with a different name. The name is derived
  from a dialog brought up using the EditorDialogs function
  pointer. Returns True if the editor was saved, False otherwise
  (i.e., the operation was canceled).

  Store the TFileEditor object on the given stream. The file
  name, not the file contents, are stored on the stream.

procedure UpdateCommands; virtual;

  Overridden to enable and disable the cmSave and cmSaveAs
  commands. They are only valid if the selected view is an
  editor, otherwise they should be disabled.

function Valid(Command: Word): Boolean; virtual;

  Overridden to make sure the file is saved before the program
  exits. Returns False if the user cancels the save.

EditorDialog: TEditorDialog;

  EditorDialog is a procedure variable that is used by TEditor
  objects to display various dialogs. Since dialogs are very
  application-dependent, EDITORS cannot display its own dialogs.
  Instead it calls this function variable instead. For an
  example of an EditorDialog function, see TVEDIT.PAS. The various
  dialog values are

    edOutOfMemory
    edReadError
    edWriteError
    edCreateError
    edSaveModify
    edSaveUntitled
    edSaveAs
    edFind
    edSearchFailed
    edReplace
    edReplacePrompt


EditorFlags: Word;

  EditorFlags contains various flags for use in the editor. The
  value of which are

    efCaseSensitive         Default to case sensitive search
    efWholeWordsOnly        Default to whole words only search
    efPromptOnReplace       Prompt on replace
    efReplaceAll            Replace all occurrences.
    efDoReplace             Do replace.
    efBackupFiles           Create .BAK files on saves.

  The default value is efBackupFiles + efPromptOnReplace.

  Stores the last value used for a find.

ReplaceStr: String[80];

  Stores the last value of a replace.

Clipboard: PEditor = nil;

  Pointer to the clipboard. Any TEditor can be the clipboard, it
  just needs be assigned to this variable. The clipboard should
  not support undo (i.e., its CanUndo should be false).

Procedures
