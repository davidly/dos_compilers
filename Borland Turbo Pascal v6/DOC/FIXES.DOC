This documentation file chronicles corrections or additions to
the printed documentation. Make sure you look at other .DOC files
in the \TP\DOC directory, especially TVISION.DOC. Note that the
\TP\DOCDEMOS directory contains complete, correct versions of all
the examples in the Turbo Vision Guide and in Chapter 4 of the
User's Guide.

  P-1  Far and near directives
  ----------------------------
    Far and near directives can be placed after a procedure or
    function declaration:

      procedure MyProc; far;
      function MyFunc: Boolean; near;

    If MyProc and MyFunc are declared in the implementaton section of
    a unit or in the body of the main program, they will be far and
    near (respectively) regardless of the enabled or disabled state of
    the {$F} compiler directive.


  P-197  Stepping into conditional breakpoints
  --------------------------------------------
    An anomaly exists when the execution bar is above a conditional
    breakpoint you've set and the condition is false. If you press F8
    in this situation, the debugger will execute the statement with
    the false conditional breakpoint without stopping. To have the
    debugger stop before executing that statement, it is not necessary
    to delete the conditional breakpoint. Instead, just position the
    cursor on the line with the false conditional berakpoint and press
    F4 (Run|Go to cursor).

  P-153  Incorrect demo program name
  ----------------------------------
    The correct name for the BGI demo program that shows how to link
    font and driver files into an EXE is called BGILINK.PAS.

  P-215  Free list
  ----------------
    The second paragraph incorrectly implies that the free list starts
    at the top of memory and grows downwards. The remaining text in
    that chapter correctly explains that the free list is maintained
    by using the first 8 bytes of each freed block.

  P-328  Allows PUBLIC without external
  -------------------------------------
    Error message #51 will no longer occur if you link with an .OBJ
    file that defines a PUBLIC for which there is no corresponding
    external Pascal procedure. When the linker encounters an unmatched
    PUBLIC in an .OBJ file, it simply creates a corresponding entry in
    the symbol table that can be referenced by EXTERNs in other .OBJ
    files.

  P-115  Incorrect demo program name
  ----------------------------------
  The correct name for the BGI demo program that shows how to
  link font and driver files into an EXE is called BGILINK.PAS.


2.  Turbo Vision Guide
----------------------

  P-29   Missing parameters
  -------------------------
  The first line of the bottom two examples should be just like
  the topmost example on the page:

      MenuBar := New(PMenuBar, Init(R, NewMenu(
       ...

  P-54   Missing parameters
  -------------------------
  The example in the middle of the page is missing parameters in
  the call to Assign. The correct syntax is:

      R.Assign(22, 3, 34, 6);

  P-157  Stream registration made easy
  ------------------------------------
  Turbo Vision defines stream registration records for all its
  objects. In addition, each Turbo Vision unit defines a
  RegisterXXXX procedure that automatically registers all of the
  unit's objects. Finally, to register all Turbo Vision objects,
  just call TApplication.RegisterTypes. Note that this will link
  in ALL Turbo Vision objects, regardless of whether you're using
  them or not (that's why it's not done automatically). See
  TVISION.DOC for more information about additional registration
  procedures.

  P-166  Incorrect method call
  ----------------------------
  The Append call in the IF statement should be a call to Insert
  as follows:

      ...
      Insert(Desktop);
      ...

  P-224  Wrong order
  ------------------
  The TCollection.Free method descriptions has the calls in
  reverse order. The correct order is:

      Delete(Item);
      FreeItem(Item);
