    2. CORRECTIONS/ADDITIONS TO THE MANUAL
    컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

    User's Guide (Volume I)

    - Page 10 - The Distribution List is inaccurate.  The correct
      list of files included with Turbo C is given in this readme
      in Section Four.

    - Page 98 - The example has a statement: 
           while ((ch=getch()) != '\n') {
      The correct statement is:
           while ((ch=getch()) != '\r') {
      Note the '\n' is changed to '\r'.

    Reference Guide (Volume II)

    - Page 29 - The description for assert says that to disable
      the assert macro, the symbol NDEBUG must be defined before the
      assert macro is used. In fact it must be placed before
      assert.h is included:

        #define NDEBUG

        #include <assert.h>

    - Page 46 - The correct usage for the bsearch function is:
        void *bsearch(void *key, void *base, int nelem,
                      int width, int (*fcmp)());
      That is, nelem is an int, not a pointer to an int, as
      given in the documentation.

    - Page 108 - The Portability paragraph for the getc function
      says that the functions described in that section (getc,
      getchar, fgetc, etc.) are all in Unix. In fact, all but getch,
      getche, and ungetch are in Unix; these others are MSDOS
      specific.

    - Page 181 - The printf chart is incorrect. The correct chart is:

      prefix  6d      6o      8x      10.2e           10.2f
      %-+#0 |+555   |01053  |0x22b    |+5.50e+000 |+5.50      |

    - Page 197 - The description of the scanf conversion type
      characters lists F to indicate a float conversion.  This
      is not correct.  F is not a valid type character.  It is
      used instead to override the default size of the corresponding
      address argument to be a far pointer.  That is, the format %F
      is not valid; it does not specify a float conversion.
      The format %Ff specifies a float conversion into an argument
      that is given with a far pointer.

    - Page 231 - The proper description for the strstr function
      is: strstr scans str1 for the first occurrence of the substring 
      str2.

    - The Merge string option (O/C/Code generation/Merge duplicate
      strings or -d) is actually default OFF, not default ON.

    - The discussion of text mode I/O in the functions close (p. 54) 
      and read (p. 188) states that Ctrl-Z is written to the end of a 
      text mode file when that file is closed, if that file was opened
      for write. That is incorrect. No Ctrl-Z is written for you. 
      If you want your text file to be terminated with a Ctrl-Z,
      you need to explicitly output one yourself. Some older programs on
      DOS require a Ctrl-Z at the end of text files. This is an outmoded
      practice inherited from CP/M.

    - The description of the intdos, intdosx, int86 and int86x
      functions is incomplete. The union REGS structure used by all
      four functions has the additional field x.flags. This field is
      set to the 8086 flags register after the system call is made.  
      This is in contrast to the x.cflag field, which simply contains 
      the state of the carry flag.

      Further, for int86x and intdosx, the segregs->es and
      segregs->ds fields are set to the values of the corresponding
      segment registers after the system call.

    - The variable int _doserrno is declared in dos.h and errno.h.

    _stklen

    Name         _stklen
    Usage        extern unsigned _stklen;
    Description

      _stklen is used to specify the size of the stack.

      In large data models (compact, large and huge), _stklen is
      the exact stack size in bytes.  In small data models
      (tiny, small and medium), _stklen is used by the startup code
      to compute the minimum size of the DATA segment:
           min DATA segment size =  size of _DATA segment +
                                    size of _BSS  segment +
                                    _stklen + MINSTACK (128 words).
      If the memory available is less than this, the startup
      aborts the program.

    _8087

    Name         _8087
    Usage        extern int _8087;
    Description

      The _8087 variable is set to 1 if an 8087 or 80287 is detected
      or if the 87 environment variable is set to Y (set 87=Y).  It is
      set to 0 otherwise.  You must have floating point code in your
      program for _8087 to be set to 1.


    3. IMPORTANT TIPS
    컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

    - When copying the *.H files from the Libraries and Header Files
      disk be sure to copy the SYS sub-directory and its contents.

    - The C startup routine (c0?.obj) parses the command line
      to set up the argc, argv arguments to main. Double quotes on
      the command line can be used to bracket a single argument that
      has embedded blanks. For example, in the following, the
      program MYPROG.EXE is invoked with three arguments:

        myprog arg1 "arg2 with embedded blanks" arg3

      The second argument contains embedded blanks.

    - Here is further explanation of the switch to disable
      register variables (-r- or O/C/Optimization/Use register
      variables..Off).  Not only will the compiler not use register
      variables, but it also will not respect and preserve register
      variables (si,di) from any caller. For that reason, you should
      not have code that uses register variables call code which has
      been compiled -r-.

    5. USING TURBO C WITH DOS 3.2 AND A FLOATING POINT COPROCESSOR
    컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

    DOS 3.2 has a bug in its handling of floating exceptions.  When
    an exception occurs, the system allocates a local stack for the
    exception handler.  Unfortunately, when a system stack gets
    allocated, it never gets deallocated.  The default number of
    stacks is 8.  After 9 floating point exceptions occur, the system
    hangs and a cold reboot is required.  Typical exceptions are
    overflow and divide by zero.  The stacks are not reclaimed when
    a program terminates, so a program which divides by zero once
    will crash the machine if run 9 times.  To avoid this problem,
    you can either:

        1. Not use DOS 3.2.
        2. Obtain a patch from IBM or Microsoft which fixes the
           bug, and install it on your copy of DOS.
        3. Not use a floating point coprocessor.
        4. Disable the exception trapping in your Turbo C program.
           You can do this easily by calling the _clear87() library
           function.  For example,

           #include <float.h>
           unsigned int fpstatus;
           /* stdlib.h included for exit, stdio.h for puts */
           #include <stdlib.h>
           #include <stdio.h>

           main()
           {
               _clear87();
               /* do floating point work here */
               /*  ...  */
               /* now, check for masked exceptions before exiting */
               fpstatus = _status87();
               if (fpstatus & SW_INVALID)
               puts("Floating point error: invalid operation.");
               if (fpstatus & SW_ZERODIVIDE)
                   puts("Floating point error: zero divide.");
               if (fpstatus & SW_OVERFLOW)
                  puts("Floating point error: overflow.");
               exit(fpstatus & (SW_INVALID | SW_ZERODIVIDE | SW_OVERFLOW));
           }


    6. HOW TO COMPILE MICROCALC
    컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

       In order to compile MicroCalc do the following:

       With TC.EXE:

         1. Run TC.EXE
         2. In the Project pulldown menu specify the project name
            "MCALC.PRJ"
         3. From the main menu select the Run option

       With TCC.EXE:

         Compile from DOS with the following command line:
           TCC mcalc mcparser mcdisply mcinput mcommand mcutil mcmvsmem.obj

       In both cases, compiling under a large data model (COMPACT, LARGE,
       or HUGE) will give you much more memory for your spreadsheets.
