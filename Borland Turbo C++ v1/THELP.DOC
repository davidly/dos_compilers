                      TURBO HELP UTILITY
                      ------------------

This file explains how to use THELP.COM. THELP is a memory-resident
utility that provides online help for Turbo Pascal and Turbo C++. If you
are using Turbo Debugger, for example, you can load THELP, then run
the debugger and get online help for Pascal or C while you are
debugging.

1.  Starting THELP
------------------

Load THELP at the DOS command line simply by typing THELP. Make sure
the Turbo help file is in the current directory or use the /F command
line option described below. The INSTALL program on the distribution
disks inserts the correct path information in THELP.


Memory Usage   - THELP requires about 20K bytes.

Default hotkey - The default hotkey is Numeric-Keypad-5 (scan
                 code 4ch, shift state 00h).

Paste speed    - The default pasting speed is FAST. You'll have
                 to experiment if it pastes too quickly for your
                 editor. Note that you should turn off autoindent
                 in the integrated environment before using the
                 paste feature.

If you are using SideKick Plus or SideKick 1.x, make sure you
load THELP before you load SideKick.


2. Command-line Options Summary
-------------------------------

  USAGE:  THELP [options]

Here is a summary of the command line options. If you use more
than one option, they must be separated by spaces.

  /Fname    Full path and filename of help file
  /H,/?,?   Display this help screen
  /Kxxyy    Change hotkey: xx=shift state(hex),
            yy=scan code(hex)
  /Px       Pasting speed: 0=slow, 1=medium, 2=fast
  /S+       Enable snow checking for video (useful for older CGA adapters).
  /S-       Disable snow checking for video (for snappier displays).
  /U        Remove THELP from memory
  /W        Write Options to THELP.COM and exit


3. Detailed Explanation of Keys Used When THELP is Active
---------------------------------------------------------

  Arrow keys:  Moves the cursor.
  PgUp/PgDn:   Moves the cursor.

  Shift-Arrow keys:  Moves the cursor while marking a block.

  TAB:         Moves the cursor to the next keyword.
  Shift-TAB:   Moves the cursor to the previous keyword.

  HOME:        Go to the beginning of the line.
  END:         Go to the end of the line.

  ENTER:       Select help entry for the item highlighted in the
               current help screen.

  ESC:         End Help.

  F1:          Help Index. F1 from any help screen brings up
               the Help Index.  You can search for a specific keyword
               incrementally.  For example, you can find "printf" by
               typing p r i.  With each letter you type, the list
               jumps to the keyword that starts with p, then to pr,
               then to pri, etc.

  ALT-F1:      Displays in reverse order the last 20 screens you
               have reviewed.

  CTL-F1:      Bring up help screen for THELP's hot keys.

  CTRL-P key:  Paste the example text into the application.



4.  Detailed Explanation of Command-line Options
------------------------------------------------

/Fname   -- Full path and filename of help file

The name that follows the /F option should be the full
drive/directory pathname of the help file to use; e.g.,

    THELP /FC:\TP\TURBO.HLP
    THELP /FC:\TURBOC\TCHELP.TCH

By default, THELP looks for the help file on the logged drive and
directory.


/H,/?,?  -- Display help screen

This option displays a summary of THELP's command-line options


/Kxxyy   -- Change hotkey: xx=shift state, yy=scan code

Virtually any shift state/scan code combination may be selected. A
quick summary of some common shift-states and scan codes follows:

  Shift States (may be OR'ed together)

    right shift    01h
    left shift     02h
    control        04h
    alt            08h

  Scan Codes

    A   --- 1eh     N   --- 31h     0   --- 0bh     F1  --- 3bh
    B   --- 30h     O   --- 18h     1   --- 02h     F2  --- 3ch
    C   --- 2eh     P   --- 19h     2   --- 03h     F3  --- 3dh
    D   --- 20h     Q   --- 10h     3   --- 04h     F4  --- 3eh
    E   --- 12h     R   --- 13h     4   --- 05h     F5  --- 3fh
    F   --- 21h     S   --- 1fh     5   --- 06h     F6  --- 40h
    G   --- 22h     T   --- 14h     6   --- 07h     F7  --- 41h
    H   --- 23h     U   --- 16h     7   --- 08h     F8  --- 42h
    I   --- 17h     V   --- 2fh     8   --- 09h     F9  --- 43h
    J   --- 24h     W   --- 11h     9   --- 0ah     F10 --- 44h
    K   --- 25h     X   --- 2dh
    L   --- 26h     Y   --- 15h
    M   --- 32h     Z   --- 2ch


  Enhanced Keyboards only (may not work with all computers, keyboards)

    F11 --- 57h
    F12 --- 58h


/Px      -- Pasting speed: 0=slow, 1=medium, 2=fast

Some editors do not accept characters pasted into the keyboard buffer
as fast as THELP can put them there. By setting an appropriate paste
speed, virtually all possible configurations of editors may be used.
FAST speed pastes as many characters as will fit on every timer tick;
MEDIUM pastes up to four characters per tick; and SLOW pastes a single
character into the buffer ONLY when the buffer is empty.

/S       -- Controls snow checking logic for video.

Some older CGA have a tendency to produce a "snow" effect when
software tries to write directly into their memory space.  If you see
this snow you should start up THELP with /S+ to enable the snow
checking code.  You may want to use the /W switch (see below) to make
it permanent.  Snow checking takes time and it is better to live
without it.  To disable snow checking use /S-; this is the default.

/U       -- Remove THELP from memory

This option is used to remove THELP from memory. If other TSRs have
been loaded after THELP, make sure to remove them before removing
THELP.


/W       -- Write Options to THELP.COM and exit

The /W parameter is used to create a new version of THELP that uses
the options you desire as a default. All options, including may be
specified and made 'permanent'.
