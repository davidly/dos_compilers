KC CHESS version 1.00.00 - by Craig Bruce and Kevin Phillips, 06-Apr-90.

If you don't know how to play chess, read a book!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAIN MENU

When the game starts, the board, conversation area, and main menu are
displayed on the screen.  To select the options from the main menu, simply
press the key indicated on the bottom of the screen.  The following options
are available:

H = Help
    Displays this help information on the screen.  The PAGE_UP and PAGE_DOWN
    keys allow you to view the separate pages of the help information.
    RETURN or SPACE may be pressed instead of PAGE_DOWN.  When finished
    viewing, press the ESCAPE key to return to the main menu.

Q = Quit
    Will exit the chess program and return to DOS.  If you do not wish to
    lose the game currently in memory, make sure you save it (File System)
    before you choose this option.

RETURN = Play game
    Places the game in PLAY MODE (see below).  The players make their moves
    until the end of the game or until the user presses ESCAPE to return to
    the main menu.  While in the main menu, the current game is merely
    suspended, and using this option again will resume it from its
    displayed position.

T = Take back move
    This option is used if you make a regrettable move and wish to un-do
    it.  If the you are currently in PLAY MODE you must press ESCAPE to
    return to the main menu to make this option accessible.  You may take
    back as many moves as you wish, all the way back to the opening move,
    since they are all stored in memory.  Each move taken back will be
    displayed on the game board by the piece moving back to where it came
    from and the conversation area information being updated as necessary.

U = Un take back move
    If you take back more moves than you meant to, then the moves can be
    made again by this option.  All taken back moves are remembered until
    a permanent move is made (in PLAY MODE).  Takeback and Untakeback may
    be used to review the last few moves of the game if you wish.

G = Goto move
    This option will allow you to go directly to any move of the game.
    The game board will clear and the computer will ask you for the move
    number you wish to go to.  See the User Input notes below for how to
    edit your input.  Entering a number that is larger than the last move
    of the game will make the computer go to the last move of the game, and
    entering a move number that is too small will go to the first move of the
    game.  Then, the computer will ask you which color's turn within the
    move to go to.  Enter B for Black or W for White.  The game board
    corresponding to the selected move will then be displayed and you will
    be returned to the main menu.

W = Watch game
    This option allows you to view the moves of the game without going
    through them 'manually' with Takeback and Untakeback.  All of the
    recorded moves will be displayed from the current position in the game
    to the end of the game.  If you are currently at the end of the game,
    the computer will go to the first move of the game and start showing the
    moves from there.  You will return to the main menu when the end of the
    game is reached, or you may exit watch mode by pressing the ESCAPE key
    at any time.

O = Options set
    This option allows you to change some of the settings of the game.  The
    game board will clear and you will be asked for the "Flash Count".  The
    default value is two.  This gives the number of times that a piece
    should be flashed on the screen to indicate that it is being moved.
    Changing this value to zero will make it so the piece is not flashed
    at all.  See the User Input section for information on how to input
    or change the value.  Press RETURN to set the Flash Count.

    Next you will be asked if you want "Sound".  Answer Y for Yes or N for
    No.  The default is Yes.  The only sound in the game is a beep when the
    computer is finished selecting its move in Play Mode or a buzz in some
    places when you do something wrong.

    Next you will be asked if you want to allow the "En Passent" priviledge
    in the game.  The default value is Yes.  Although it is rarely used,
    you may wish to set it to No if you don't know what it is and you don't
    want the computer to do it to you.

    Next you will be asked for the "Watch Delay" in milliseconds.  This is
    the time that the computer will delay between showing moves in Watch
    Mode.  The default value is 700 milliseconds (0.7 seconds).  The minimum
    and maximum allowed values are 0 and 30000.  Do not enter any commas
    in the number.  If the number entered is improper, the default value of
    700 will be used.

    Finally, you will be asked for the "Time Limit" for the game.  If either
    player's elapsed time (shown in the player info blocks in the conversation
    area) meets or exceeds the time limit, then that player loses and the
    game is over.  The default value is 00:00:00 (in HH:MM:SS format), which
    means that there is no time limit.  Changing this value will cause the
    time limit to be enforced.  The value entered must be in the exact format
    of HH:MM:SS or the default value will be used.  After entering this value,
    the chess board will be displayed and the main menu will be re-entered.

P = Player info
    This option allows you to change the various attributes of each player.
    The game board will clear and you will be asked for the white player's
    Name.  Enter the name you wish to use and press RETURN.  You may use
    BACKSPACE to eliminate any unwanted characters.

    Next you will be asked for the white player's Elapsed Time.  Enter this
    value in the format "HH:MM:SS" or the program will use the value 00:00:00.
    In play mode, the move time will be added to this time.  The move Takeback
    and Untakeback options do not update or un-update the elapsed time (you
    can't roll back the hands of time), so if you wish to take back moves and
    resume play from some lower elapsed time, you must enter the new elapsed
    time value here.

    Next you will be asked for the player type of the white player.  You may
    enter H for Human or M for Machine.  Use BACKSPACE to delete the current
    setting.  If you enter an invalid character, the default of Machine will
    be used.  You may enter either Human or Machine for either player (white
    or black), allowing four combinations.  Human vs. Human would be like
    playing on a real board and Machine vs. Machine would be a demonstration
    of the program.

    Next you will be asked for the "Lookahead".  For a Machine player this
    gives the number of half-moves (plys) to look ahead of the current
    board position in figuring out the best move to make, and for a Human
    player this gives the number of plys to look ahead if the human asks for
    a hint.  To change the setting, press BACKSPACE to delete the current
    value and enter the new value.  Zero to three ply lookaheads will not
    require much time, but four and higher lookaheads can require a
    considerable lookahead time.  The following table gives the ranges of the
    move consideration times with Position Evaluation (below) on and off for
    a 10 MHz PS/2 Model 30/286, in the format MM:SS.  The true move time will
    be different on different computers and will vary with the complexity of
    the board configuration.

                 POSITION EVALUATION OFF        POSITION EVALUATION ON
         PLYS     Low    Average    High        Low    Average    High
           0      0:00     0:00     0:00        0:00     0:00     0:01
           1      0:00     0:00     0:01        0:00     0:01     0:02
           2      0:00     0:01     0:01        0:01     0:03     0:05
           3      0:01     0:07     0:13        0:05     0:15     0:45
           4      0:06     0:45     2:55        0:19     1:20     4:25
           5        around  8 minutes
           6        around 20 minutes

    Next you will be asked if "Position Evaluation" should be used in the
    consideration of moves when the computer is looking for the best move.
    This consideration is used to break 'ties' for best material score by
    examining the formation of pieces, etc. and following a number of special
    rules.  (Please note that the rules followed and the positional score
    generated are not very sound or scientific, and were designed by a definite
    chess non-expert).  The drawback to enabling option is that it may take
    significantly more time for the computer to select a move (for technical
    reasons).  The default is to enable position evaluation, and this is
    reflected in the conversation area by showing a "+" on the end of the
    Machine Skill Level.

    Then, all of these same questions will be asked for the black player, and
    after that, you will return to the main menu.

N = New game
    This option will set the pieces on the board to the startup formation of a
    new game, update the move number and player status settings appropriately,
    and will enter Play Move as if you had pressed RETURN.

S = Setup board
    Allows you to set up the pieces on the board how you wish.  See the SETUP
    MODE section below for more information.

F = File system
    Causes you to enter the file system.  See the FILE SYSTEM section below.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLAY MODE

Accepts moves from the players, makes them, and continues until the game is
finished or the user presses ESCAPE to return to the main menu.  The color and
name of the player whose move it is are displayed at the bottom of the screen
and the elapsed time of the player to move will tick away.

Human Player:

If the player to move is Human, then the cursor (green) will blink on the
game board and the computer will wait for the you to move the cursor, pick up
the piece that you want to move, and put it where you want to move it.  To
move the cursor, use the cursor keys.  The HOME, END, PAGE_UP, and PAGE_DOWN
keys are also active in moving the cursor.  The will 'wrap-around' to the other
side of the board if you move it 'off' an edge.  Move the cursor on top of the
piece you wish to move and then press RETURN or SPACE to pick it up.  The
square will be displayed in the lower section of the conversation area.

Then move the cursor to the position where you wish to move the piece and press
RETURN or SPACE.  The full code for the move will be displayed in the
conversation area, and the computer will check if the move is valid.  If it is
not, the computer will buzz and display "Invalid Move", and you will be put
back to the pick-up phase of selecting the move.  If it is not obvious why the
move you attempted is invalid, see if moving the piece would result in you
being in check.  (Please note that it is illegal to castle while in check and
it is illegal to castle "through" check).  If you pick up a piece that you
decide you really do not want to move, press BACKSPACE to put it back down.

In the event that the move you made was a pawn promotion, after displaying
the move, the computer will ask you which piece you wish to promote the pawn
to.  You may press Q = Queen, R = Rook, B = Bishop, or N = kNight.  The piece
will then be promoted.

The following keys may also be used when you are entering your move:

H = ask for Hint
    Will ask the computer to suggest a move for you to make.  This move will be
    generated using the skill level and position evaluation setting for the
    human player.  The  computer will display "Thinking" and will show the
    suggested move a short (or long) time later.  You may enter this suggestion
    as above, or you may use your own choice of move.

A = Attack/protect count
    Will display the number of times the cursor square is attacked (threatened)
    by enemy pieces and protected by friendly pieces.  This is provided to
    let you make sure you are not failing to notice that a square is attacked
    or protected.

C = Check move list
    Will display the list of all of your possible moves on the screen.  Press
    any key after you are finished viewing the list to return to entering your
    move.

Machine Player:

If the player to move is Machine, the computer will think about its move for
a period of time and will finally make the move.  While it's thinking, it will
display the 'best' move it has found so far and that move's Score, EnemyScore,
and Positional Score.  The EnemyScore is the highest score that the computer
thinks its enemy can achieve after the computer makes the move that it is
currently showing as best.  For skill levels of three and above, the computer
will also display a Scan countdown (the number of moves left to analyze) and
will begin its analysis with a 'PreScan'.  The written report for this project
goes into detail on exactly how the computer 'thinks'.

If you get tired of waiting for the computer to think of its move, you may
press the M key to force the computer to make the best move it has found so
far.  This key (and the ESCAPE key) is checked only when the scan count is
updated, so it may take a little time for the computer to react to your
pressing the key.  BE PATIENT.  If the computer is taking too long to think,
you may wish to use the Player Info option in the main menu to lower the
lookahead for the Machine player.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SETUP MODE

This mode allows you to set the pieces on the board as you wish.  The only
restrictions are that there must be exactly one king on the board for each
player and they cannot both be in check, and a pawn cannot be placed on row one
or row eight.  Move the cursor around the board with the cursor keys to a
square that you wish to modify.  Then use one of the following keys to place
the piece: K = King, Q = Queen, R = Rook, B = Bishop, N = kNight, P = Pawn, and
SPACE = <no piece>.  If you type SPACE, whatever was under the cursor will
disappear; otherwise, if you typed one of the other keys, the cursor will
disappear and you will be asked for the color of the piece you wish to add.
Type B for Black or W for White.

If you are placing a king or a rook it its 'home' position, the computer will
ask you if the piece has moved from its starting position since the start of
the game.  This is necessary for the computer to know if castling is still
possible.  This question will not be asked for other pieces.  Now, the new
piece will be displayed on the board under the cursor.  You may move the cursor
to the next place you wish to put the next piece.

If you wish to clear the entire board to start from scratch, press the C key.
If you wish to set pieces on the board to their startup positions, press the D
key (Default).

When you are finished modifying the board, press RETURN to accept the setup.
You will then be asked for the current move number and then the player who is
to move next.  Enter these values and use BACKSPACE to delete the current
value.  After this, you will be returned to the main menu.  Note that all of
the previous moves of the current game (if there are any) will be lost, and the
setup you have input will be considered as the opening board configuration.

If you entered setup mode accidentally or you are not satisfied with the setup
you have created, you may press ESCAPE to exit back to the main menu and
restore the board configuration that was present before you entered Setup mode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FILE SYSTEM

The file system allows you to Load, Save, or Print out the current game, or
obtain a listing of all of the chess games in the current directory.  The
options are selected with the following keys:

ESC = return to main menu

L = Load game
    The chess board will clear and you will be asked for the name of the game
    (file) to load into memory.  Press RETURN to use the default filename or
    use BACKSPACE and then type in another name.  Note that although all games
    are saved with a ".CHS" extension, you do not have to type this.  After you
    have entered the filename, the game will load and the final board position
    will be displayed, or the message "I/O Error" will be displayed if
    something went wrong.  Press a key for the latter case.

S = Save current game
    The chess board will clear and you will be asked for the name to save the
    current game under.  Press RETURN to use the default filename or use
    BACKSPACE and then type in another name.  Although chess games are saved
    with a ".CHS" extension, you do not have to type this.  The game will then
    be saved and you will return to the file menu.  If anything went wrong,
    "I/O Error" will be displayed; press a key to continue.

P = Print out current game
    You will be asked for the filename to print the output for the game to.
    The default of "PRN" (the DOS standard printer) will be shown.  You may
    change this filename if you wish (to print to a disk file).  The listing
    will then be printed, and "I/O Error" will be displayed if something went
    wrong.  The listing will show all of the moves of the game and a
    representation of the final board setup.

D = show Directory listing of chess games
    The screen will clear and the directory will be displayed.  Press RETURN
    after viewing the listing to return to the File Menu.  Note that this
    option calls the DOS program "COMMAND.COM" and it must be found either in
    the current directory or in some directory in the PATH environmental
    variable.  Also, the COMMAND.COM found MUST be for the same version of DOS
    that the system was booted up under, or an error may be displayed or the
    system may simply crash.  MAKE SURE that the chess program is installed to
    use a good COMMAND.COM or do not use this option.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USER INPUT MODE

The design objective of the User Input subroutine was simplicity of
implementation, and thus, it is fairly limited.  When you are put into User
Input mode by Player Info, set Options, Filename, or other places in the
program, the only editing key that you may use is BACKSPACE (like DOS input).
This key will delete the last character of the input string and move the cursor
back one position.  Usually when input mode is entered, a default string is
provided.  If you wish to change the default or enter something entirely
different, you will have to BACKSPACE out what you don't want before you type
in what you do want.

To type in new characters, simply type the key.  Only the letter keys, number
keys, and a few punctuation keys are accepted.  The new character will be
displayed and the cursor will move one space to the right.  If this does not
happen, then you have reached the limit of the number of characters you are
allowed to input.  You may still use BACKSPACE if you wish.

When you are finished entering the string (or you have not made any changes to
the default string and you wish to use it), press RETURN.  This will end the
User Input Mode and the string you have entered will be given to the computer
and processed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FINAL NOTE

To the best of our knowledge, this program is completely free of bugs; however,
of course, it is impossible to guarantee this.  If you find any errors in this
program, we would like to know about them.  Thank you much.
