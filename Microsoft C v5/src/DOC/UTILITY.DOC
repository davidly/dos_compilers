		Release notes for the Microsoft(R) Utilities

	      (C) Copyright Microsoft Corporation, 1987, 1988


This document contains information about the Microsoft(R) CodeView(R) debugger
and utilities. Note that the file ERRMSG.DOC contains new and changed error
messages for all of the software included with the Microsoft C Optimizing
Compiler Version 5.10, including utilities and the compiler itself.

The information in this document is more up to date than that in the printed
manuals. Where information in the manuals conflicts with this document, you
should assume that this document contains the correct information.

Microsoft improves its language documentation at the time of reprinting, so
some of the information in this on-line file may already be included in your
manuals.


========================< The Mouse Driver >===================================

If you will be using the Microsoft Mouse with the Microsoft CodeView debugger
you must have Version 6.0 or later of the Microsoft Mouse. If you do not,
use the version of the MOUSE.COM driver provided in this package.  Copy
MOUSE.COM to the appropriate mouse directory. When you are ready to use the
mouse, type

	mouse

at the DOS command level. If you want to install the mouse driver automatically
every time you reboot,  insert the "mouse" command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

Note that in earlier releases of Microsoft C, both the MOUSE.SYS and the
MOUSE.COM driver were provided.  If you have been using an earlier version
of the MOUSE.SYS driver, delete the following line from your CONFIG.SYS file:

	device=\<directory>\mouse.sys

where <directory> is the directory where the earlier mouse driver resides.


=================< Microsoft(R) CodeView(R) Debugger >=========================


New Command-Line Option
-----------------------
If you have an IBM(R) Personal System/2, then you can use the /50
command-line option to start the CodeView debugger in 50-line mode.
Note that you must be in 25-line mode to effectively use either the
/43 or /50 command-line option.

Compiling BASIC Programs for CodeView Debugger
----------------------------------------------
To compile BASIC programs for use with the CodeView debugger, specify the
/Zi option rather than the /D option.

Expression Evaluator for BASIC Programs
---------------------------------------
In the BASIC expression evaluator, "+" is not supported for string
concatenation.

Stack Trace Command
-------------------
In order for the Stack Trace command (or the Calls menu) to work
reliably, you need to execute to at least the beginning of the main
function or procedure, and the current module should have full CodeView
information (a module has full CodeView information if compiled or
assembled with /Zi).

Error Messages
--------------
The error message "? cannot display" indicates that the Display
Expression command (?) has been passed a valid symbol that it
cannot display. In previous versions of the debugger, structures
could not be displayed. With current version of the debugger, only
the enums type cannot be displayed.

The error message "Expression not a memory address" occurs when
the Tracepoint command is given without a symbol that evaluates to
a single memory address.  For example, the commands "TP?1" and
"TP?a+b" each produce this error message.  The proper way to put a
tracepoint on the word at address 1 is with the command "TPW 1".

The error message "Function call before 'main'" occurs when you
attempt to evaluate a program-defined function before you have entered
the main function.  Execute to at least to the beginning of the main
function before attempting to evaluate program-defined functions.

The error message "Bad emulator info" occurs when CodeView cannot
read data from the floating-point emulator.

The error message "Floating point not loaded" has a special meaning
for CVP (in addition to the explanation given in the Microsoft CodeView
and Utilities manual).	Each thread has its own floating-point emulator.
This message is issued when the current thread has not initialized
its own emulator.

Microsoft Pascal Programs
-------------------------
In this release, Microsoft Pascal programs cannot be debugged with
the CodeView debugger.


The Pascal example on pg. 61 of the Microsoft CodeView and Utilities
manual should read 

	PAS1 /Zz TEST;

rather than

	PAS1 /Zi TEST;

========================< Exit Codes for Utilities >===========================

The exit codes for LINK and the utilities in the Microsoft CodeView
and Utilities manual should appear as follows:

LINK
----
	Code	Meaning

	0	No error.

	2	Program error--something was wrong with the commands
		or files input to the linker.

	4	System error.  The linker

		- ran out of space on output files
		- was unable to reopen the temporary file
		- experienced an internal error
		- was interrupted by the user

LIB, EXEPACK, EXEMOD, MAKE, and SETENV
---------------------------------------
	Code	Meaning

	0	No error.

	2	Program error--something was wrong with the commands
		or files input to the utility.

	4	System error.  The utility ran out of memory, was
		interrupted by the user, or experienced an internal
		error.

============< Microsoft Segmented-Executable Linker (LINK) >===================

Overlay Restrictions
--------------------
You cannot use long jumps (using the longjmp library function) or indirect
calls (through a function pointer) to pass control to an overlay.  When a
function is called through a pointer, the called function must be in the same
overlay or in the root.

=================<  Microsoft Library Manager (LIB) >==========================

New Option
----------
There is a new option for LIB:  /NOIGNORECASE (abbreviated as /N).
This option tells LIB to not ignore case when comparing symbols.
By default, LIB ignores case.  Multiple symbols that are
the same except for case can be put in the same library.  An
example of this is: "_Open" and "_open". Normally you could not
add both these symbols to the same library.

Note that if a library is built with /NOI, the library is
internally "marked" to indicate /NOI.	All libraries built
with earlier versions of LIB are not marked.

If you combine multiple libraries, and any one of them is
marked /NOI, then /NOI is assumed for the output library.

In addition, LIB also supports the option /IGNORECASE (/I), which
is completely analogous to /NOIGNORECASE.  /I is the default. The only
reason to use it would be if you have an existing library marked /NOI
that you wanted to combine with other libraries that were not marked,
and have the output library be not marked. If you don't use
/IGNORECASE, the output is marked /NOI (see above).

=============< Microsoft Program Maintenance Utility (MAKE) >==================

Inference Rules
---------------
You cannot have inference rules in both the TOOLS.INI and the description
file that use the same inextension and outextension.  For example, you
cannot place the following inference rule in the TOOLS.INI file:

	.c.obj:
		cl /c /Zi /Od $*.c

while also placing the following line in the description file:

	.c.obj:
		cl /Ot $*.c

However, you can define the same macro in both the TOOLS.INI and the
description file.  In such cases, the definition in the TOOLS.INI file
takes precedence.

Backslash (\) as Continuation Character
---------------------------------------
Note that MAKE considers a backslash immediately followed by a new-line
character to be a continuation character.  When it finds this combination
in a description file, MAKE concatenates the line immediately following
the combination with the line where the combination appears.

If you define a macro that ends in a backslash, make sure that you put a
space after the terminating backslash.  For example, if you want to define
macros for the path C:\SRC\BIN and C:\SRC\LIB, you must use the format 
illustrated below:

	BINPATH=C:\SRC\BIN\<space><newline>
	LIBPATH=C:\SRC\LIB\<space><newline>

To illustrate the problems that can result if you do not put a space before the
new-line character, assume that the macros above appear as shown below
instead: 

	BINPATH=C:\SRC\BIN\<newline>
	LIBPATH=C:\SRC\LIB\<newline>

Because a new-line character appears immediately after the backslash at the end
of the first macro, MAKE assumes that you are defining the single macro shown
below:

	BINPATH=C:\SRC\BIN\LIBPATH=C:\SRC\LIB\


==========< Microsoft STDERR Redirection Utility (ERROUT) >====================

The ERROUT utility does not accept batch files. To redirect standard-error
output from a batch file, you must enter a command of the following form:

	ERROUT COMMAND /c <batchcommand> 

If no /f option is given, then ERROUT redirects standard-error output to
the standard-output device.

==========================< Microsoft Editor >=================================

Installing the Editor
---------------------
The Microsoft Editor does not come with an MESETUP program. Instead,
run the setup program for the compiler. This program offers you choices
about how to set up the editor.

Keystroke Configurations
------------------------
Some of the keystroke configurations listed in Table A.2 of the
Microsoft Editor User's Guide may need to be changed.

In the Quick/WordStar(R) configuration, the Sinsert function is assigned
to ALT+INS, not CTRL+INS.

In the BRIEF(R) configuration, the Plines function is assigned to ALT+D,
and the Refresh function is assigned to CTRL+].

In the Epsilon(TM) configuration, the Ppage function is assigned to PGDN,
and the Sdelete function is assigned to DEL and CTRL+D.

The Compile Function
--------------------
The commands

	Arg streamarg Compile
        Arg textarg Compile

each use the command specified by the extmake:text switch.  The
editor does not check the extension of the file name given as an
argument, but instead uses the "text" extension.  The streamarg
or textarg replaces a %s in the command.  These commands are typically
used to invoke MAKE.

The Setfile Function
--------------------
The commands that use Setfile, along with a streamarg or textarg,
accept a variety of input: either the name of a file, a file name
with a wild-card character (* or ?), the name of a directory, or the
name of a disk drive.  File names can also include environment variables,
such as $INIT.  If the streamarg or textarg is a directory name, then
the editor changes the current directory.  If the argument is a drive
name, then the editor changes the current drive.  Environment variables
are translated into directories to be searched for a file.  For example,
the following macro directs the editor to search the $INIT environment
variable in order to find the tools.ini file:

    tools.ini := Arg "$INIT:tools.ini" Setfile


Entering Strings in Macros
--------------------------
When you enter a text argument directly, no characters have special
meaning (except when the argument is interpreted as a regular
expression).  However, when you enter text as part of a macro, then
strings inside of quotes are interpreted according to the C string
format.  This format uses a backslash followed by double quotes (\")
to represent double quotes and it uses two backslashes (\\) to represent
a single backslash.  Therefore, to find the next occurrence of the string

    She wrote, "Here is a backslash: \ "

you could use the following macro definition:

    findit := Arg "She wrote, \"Here is a backslash: \\ \"" Psearch

Note that to indicate a backslash for a regular expression that is
also part of a macro definition, you must use four consecutive
backslashes.


Using Text Switches
-------------------
The text switches extmake and readonly each take a special
kind of syntax that allows you to specify drive, file name,
base name, or file extension. The syntax consists of the
characters:

%|<letters>F

where <letters> consists of any of the following: "p" for path,
"d" for drive, "f" for file base name, or "e" for file extension.
For example, if you are editing the file c:\dir1\sample.c, and you
make the following switch assignment:

extmake:c cl /Fod:%|pfF %|dfeF

then each time you give the command <Arg><Compile>, the editor
performs the following system-level command:

cl /Fod:\dir1\sample c:sample.c

The expression "%s" is equivalent to "%|feF" except that the former
only works once, whereas the latter can appear any number of times
in the extmake switch assignment. The expression "%|F" is equivalent
to "%|dpfeF".

The filetab Switch
------------------
The filetab switch is a numeric switch that determines how the
editor translates tabs when loading a file into memory.  The value
of the switch gives the number of spaces associated with each tab
column.  For example, the setting "filetab:4" assumes a tab column
every 4 positions on each line.  Every time the editor finds a tab
character in a file, it loads the buffer with the number of spaces
necessary to get to the next tab column.  Depending on the value of
the entab switch, the editor also uses the filetab switch to determine
how to convert spaces into tabs when writing to a file.  The default
value of filetab is 8.

Functions Callable by C Extensions
----------------------------------
The following list summarizes functions from the standard compact-
memory-model library, which should work when called by a C-extension
module.  (The technique of programming C extensions is presented in 
Chapter 8 of the Microsoft Editor User's Guide.)  The memory model
of the extension is assumed to be /Asfu (small code pointers, far
data pointers, and stack segment unequal to data segment).  This list
uses the function categories from Chapter 4 of the Microsoft C
Optimizing Compiler Run-Time Library Reference (Version 4.0
or later.)
