                     QuickAssembler Compiler, Version 2.51


===========================< Samples List >================================

In addition to examples in the Quick Advisor, the following
sample programs are provided with QuickAssembler. The main
program files (FILEDEMO.C, MATHDEMO.C and MISCDEMO.ASM) contain
calls to routines in the support modules (FILE.ASM, MATH.ASM,
MISC.ASM, and COMMON.ASM).

     Files              Description
     -----              -----------

     FILEDEMO.MAK       FILEDEMO illustrates DOS functions related to
     FILEDEMO.C         file handling. It also illustrates many general
     FILE.ASM           instructions and directives. Most of the procedures
			in FILE.ASM are also included in on-line help.

     MATHDEMO.MAK	MATHDEMO creates a simple calculator. It primarily
     MATHDEMO.C 	illustrates instructions related to numeric
     MATH.ASM           calculations. Many general instructions and
                        directives are also illustrated. Most of the
                        procedures in MATH.ASM are also included in
			on-line help.

     MISCDEMO.MAK       MISCDEMO illustrates miscellaneous instructions,
     MISCDEMO.ASM       directives, DOS functions, and BIOS functions.
     MISC.ASM           Most of the procedures in MISC.ASM are also
			included in on-line help.

     COMMON.ASM 	This is an assembly-language module containing
			assembly procedures used by FILEDEMO, MATHDEMO, and
                        MISCDEMO. The procedures in it are also
			included in on-line help.

     DEMO.INC		These are include files used by the assembly and
     DEMO.H		C modules. DEMO.H is included by all C modules;
			DEMO.INC is included by all the assembly-language
			modules. The constants and structures are
			equivalent in both files. DEMO.INC also has
			assembly language macros that are duplicated in
			the on-line help.

The sample programs can be used in connection with on-line help. When
you examine a help topic that has an example procedure, macro, or data
structure, you may also wish to see the example used in context in an
example program. You can load the appropriate sample program and search
for instances of the help topic. You may also wish to trace through
samples to see step-by-step execution of sample code.
