                       ===========================

  This document should be regarded as a supplement to the chapter Writing
  Programs in your Operating Guide. It gives some guidelines which, if
  followed, allow your COBOL system to optimize fully the native code
  produced for your programs - resulting in smaller and faster applications.

  INTRODUCTION

  The guidelines are set out in a "Do this" / "Don't do that" style. Do
  remember that these are only guidelines; programs that do not conform to
  these guidelines will still run correctly, just less efficiently.

  For further information on many of the topics discussed in this document,
  see chapter Compiling and chapter Writing Programs in your Operating
  Guide.


  DATA DIVISION CONSIDERATIONS

  Data Types
  ----------
   o  Use unsigned COMP-5 or COMP-X numeric data items; preferably COMP-5.

   o  Use 2-byte COMP-5 items rather than single byte fields for arithmetic.

   o  Do not use numeric items that occupy more than 4 bytes of storage.

   o  Do not redefine COMP-5 items to access individual bytes; if access to
      individual bytes is required use COMP-X.

   o  Use edited items only when necessary and use only simple ones such as
      ZZ9. If possible use them in a subroutine so the total number of
      edited moves in your program is kept as small as possible.

   o  Do not use items defined as EXTERNAL.

   o  Align items on even byte boundaries and ensure the stride of a table
      is an even number, if possible a power of 2 (pad the table as
      necessary). The stride of a table is the size of one element; for
      example, the stride of the following table is 2 bytes:

      01 a occurs 10.
          05 b pic x
          05 c pic x.


  Linkage Items
  -------------
   o  Don't make many references to items defined in the Linkage Section
      (examples: linkage parameters; x"D0" allocated memory). It is more
      efficient to move the data to Working-Storage, manipulate it there,
      then move it back again.

   o  If a parameter is optional you can detect its presence  using the
      following syntax:

      IF ADDRESS OF linkage-item NOT = NULL


  Large Data Divisions
  --------------------
   o  Ensure the size of your Data Division is less than 64 kilobytes (64K),
      keeping the total size as small as possible. In the Procedure Division
      the RTS can swap segments, but it cannot page the Data Division.

   o  Redefine memory that is only used during certain phases of a program's
      execution so that it can be shared by several routines.

   o  If more than 64K of data is required use a heap, or use the x"D0"
      COBOL System Library Routine to allocate the space dynamically. But
      remember x"D0" items have the disadvantage of being Linkage items.

   o  Do not use the NOSMALLDD directive unless you have no choice. If
      necessary (normally for parameters passed to your program by external
      programs), use the SEGCROSS directive so that the performance of most
      data accesses is not affected.


  PROCEDURE DIVISION CONSIDERATIONS

  Arithmetic Statements
  ---------------------
   o  Use simple forms (for example, ADD a TO b) of the arithmetic verbs and
      do not use the COMPUTE verb.

   o  Do not use the GIVING form of these verbs. If necessary create
      temporary variables and code several simple statements to achieve the
      same result. For example, write:

          MOVE a TO c
          ADD  b TO c

      rather than:

          ADD a TO b giving c

   o  Do not mix items of different sizes in an arithmetic statement (for
      example, try to use all 2-byte items or all 4-byte items).

   o  Do not use the REMAINDER, ROUNDED, ON SIZE ERROR or CORRESPONDING
      phrases.


  Alphanumeric Data Manipulation
  ------------------------------
   o  Reference modified fields are optimized if coded in one of the
      following forms:

      item (literal:)
      item (literal:literal)
      item (literal:variable)
      item (variable:variable)
      item (variable + literal:literal)
      item (variable - literal:literal)
      item (variable + literal:variable)
      item (variable - literal:variable)

      Other forms of reference modification are inefficient.

   o  If the offset or length of the reference modification is a data item,
      use a 2-byte COMP-5 item. Define it in Working-Storage.

   o  In a MOVE statement, have the source item the same size as or larger
      than the target. This prevents space-padding code being generated.

   o  Do not use the INITIALIZE verb.

   o  Do not use the CORRESPONDING option of the MOVE verb.

   o  Do not use the STRING or UNSTRING verbs - they create a lot of code.
      For manipulating filenames use the COBOL System Library Routines
      CBL_SPLIT_FILENAME and CBL_JOIN_FILENAME. For other purposes, create
      your own loops; they will almost always be more efficient.


  Tables
  ------
   o  The optimal definition for a subscript is a 2-byte COMP-5 item.

   o  Subscripts for items that have the same stride and are used in
      consecutive statements are optimized so that they are only evaluated
      once. For example:

          01 A PIC XX OCCURS 10.
          01 B PIC XX OCCURS 10.
          01 C PIC XX OCCURS 10.
          01 D PIC XX OCCURS 10.
              . . .
              MOVE A(I) TO B(I)
              IF C(I) = D(I)
                  DISPLAY "PASS"
              END-IF

      would result in the subscript I being evaluated only once, although it
      is used four times in two statements.

   o  When compiling your program for use in production, use the NOBOUND
      directive so that subscript range checking code is not included. Use
      BOUND only when debugging.


  Conditional Statements
  ----------------------
   o  Do not use large EVALUATE statements. They are compiled into a series
      of IF ... ELSE IF ... statements where the value of the expression is
      derived separately for each WHEN clause.

   o  Order an EVALUATE statement so that the most commonly satisfied
      condition is tried first. Do not use complex expressions or Linkage
      items as conditions in an EVALUATE statement; instead, calculate the
      value yourself in a Working-Storage item and use that item.

   o  Comparing for equality or inequality is more efficient than testing
      for "greater than" or "less than", especially with COMP-X or
      alphanumeric items.

   o  In both alphanumeric and numeric comparisons, have the source and
      target items the same size.

   o  Use a GO TO ... DEPENDING statement if the range of possible values is
      fairly close. Although this construct has the disadvanage of not being
      particularly suited to structured programming, it is efficient.


   Loops and Subroutines
   ---------------------
   o  When incrementing or decrementing a counter, terminate it with a
      literal value rather than a value held in a data item. For example, to
      execute a loop n times, set the counter to n and then decrement the
      counter until it becomes zero, rather than incrementing the counter
      from 0 to n.

   o  The range of an out-of-line PERFORM statement should not contain the
      end of another perform range. (One way to ensure this is to perform
      sections only, not paragraphs; however, with carefully structured
      programming this should not arise). You can then compile your program
      with the generator directive NOTRICKLE, which lets the compiler
      produce more efficient code. This coding style generally gives you a
      more easily maintained program too.

   o  Do not use PERFORM a THRU b as this too can lead to trickling code.

   o  Use PERFORM para N TIMES but not the equivalent in-line perform.

   o  Put commonly used pieces of code in sections or paragraphs and PERFORM
      them. This is saves space for any statement used more than once that
      produces more than 4 bytes of generated code (in a NOTRICKLE program).
      It is often beneficial even on single statements, for example edited
      moves, subprogram calls or file I/O.


  CALL statements
  ---------------
   o  Try to limit the number of CALL statements a program makes, if
      necessary by avoiding splitting it into too many subprograms.

   o  CALL statements that do not alter the RETURN-CODE special register or
      whose effect on RETURN-CODE are of no interest should use a calling
      convention of 4 (the checker directive DEFAULTCALLS can be used to set
      this globally).

   o  Calls to the COBOL System Library Routines that carry out logical
      operations (CBL_AND, etc) are optimized by the generator to actual
      machine logical operations, providing the parameters are 8 bytes long
      or less. These too should use a calling convention of 4.

   o  Use the generator directive NOPARAMCOUNTCHECK if your program is
      always called with the correct number of parameters, or if it does not
      reference unsupplied parameters. Most programs will fall into this
      category.


  Large Procedure Divisions
  -------------------------
   o  On DOS or OS/2, code segments are limited in size to 64K. Do not let
      the generator decide where to break your program into segments.
      Instead segment the program manually, that is, by using the segment
      number on a section header, so you can choose where to split it. Avoid
      inter-segment PERFORM and GO TO statements.

   o  If appropriate the memory needed can be reduced by manually segmenting
      a procedure division smaller than 64K. As the RTS can segment-swap
      procedural code this is rarely necessary.


  DIRECTIVES

  A number of checker and generator directives can be used to enable the
  native code for a program to be better optimized. Some of these directives
  must be used with care; ensure that the behavior that you get with these
  directives is acceptable.

  Use the following directives when checking and generating your programs:

       NOALTER
       ALIGN(2)
       NONESTCALL
       OPTSIZE

   Use with care:

       NOTRICKLE
       DEFAULTCALLS(4)
       NOPARAMCOUNTCHECK

   Use when compiling for production:

       NOANIM
       NOBOUND

   Other suggestions (to help prevent inefficient coding):

       REMOVE "UNSTRING"
       REMOVE "STRING"
       REMOVE "GIVING"
       REMOVE "ROUNDED"
       REMOVE "COMPUTE"
       REMOVE "ERROR"
       REMOVE "ALTER"
       REMOVE "INITIALIZE"
       REMOVE "CORRESPONDING"
       REMOVE "TALLYING"
       REMOVE "THRU"
       REMOVE "THROUGH"


  EXAMINING THE NATIVE CODE

  You can see the generated code produced for your program, by using the
  generator directives ASMLIST() SOURCEASM to produce a .GRP file containing
  the assembler and source listing in the same file.

  If the generator considers a statement for optimization, but finds that it
  does not conform to the necessary guidelines, the word "BADCODE" appears
  next to the statement, on the right-hand side of the listing. But some
  statements that have generated inefficient code will not have been
  identified in this way; you can usually spot these by looking for a single
  statement that has generated a lot of assembler code.

  Try to eliminate or at least reduce the inefficient statements in your
  program. But be aware of the law of diminishing returns; as you improve
  the efficiency of your program, you will eventually reach a point where a
  lot of extra effort will give only small further gains.
