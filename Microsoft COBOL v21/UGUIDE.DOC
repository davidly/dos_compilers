CHAPTER 3    Compiling

        3.1  Invoking the Compiler

        3.1.3 Using Compiler Switches

    An additional compile time switch has been added to
    MS-COBOL.

Switches

    /G

      This switch causes any program statements with a "D"
      in column 7 to be compiled, rather than being treated
      as comments. Specifying this switch has the same effect
      as specifying WITH DEBUGGING MODE in the SOURCE-COMPUTER
      paragraph in the ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.

CHAPTER 7     Data Input and Output

        7.3   Using MS-DOS and Nondisk FIles

    To send an output file to the printer, use the SELECT
    file-name ASSIGN TO PRINTER clause. Then, in an associated
    FD, specify the clause LABEL RECORD IS OMITTED. DO not
    specify the VALUE OF FILE-ID clause. 
    
    The FILE-STATUS data-item for a PRINTER file will not be 
    updated; You may receive MS-DOS messages if a printer is
    not attached or is not on-line, but the FILE-STATUS item
    will not change from its initial value. Be sure to check 
    your printer before writing to it.

CHAPTER 10    Interprogram Communication

      10.5  Calling MS-COBOL Extension Subroutines

   Two additional Extension Subroutines, KBDAVAIL and
   CURPOS, are now available. KBDAVAIL allows a COBOL
   program to check whether keyboard data has been 
   entered, without having to wait for such entry,
   or having to read the data. CURPOS allows a COBOL
   program to examine the current line and column 
   value of the screen cursor.

   Note that to call these or any other extension 
   subroutines, the routine name must be entered
   in UPPER-CASE in the CALL statement.


   Name and function:

   KBDAVAIL     Indicates whether data is available
                at the keyboard, without actually
                reading the data.

   CURPOS       Returns the line and column location
                of the screen cursor at the time of 
                the call.

   Calling conventions:

   CALL "KBDAVAIL" USING status.
   
   CALL "CURPOS" USING line-val, column-val.

   Arguments:

   status       A alphanumeric two-character 
                data-item (PIC XX). Returned 
                status values are described below.

   line-val     A numeric data-name with USAGE 
                COMP-0. The current cursor line
                will be returned here.

   column-val   A numeric data-name with USAGE 
                COMP-0. The current cursor column
                will be returned here.

	
   Returned status values:

   Status Code:  "00"
              For KBDAVAIL, "00" indicates 
              keyboard data has been entered.

   Status Code:  "30"
              For KBDAVAIL, "30" indicates 
              keyboard data has not been entered.


   Programming notes:

   KBDAVAIL can be used to check whether data
   has been entered at the keyboard, without 
   having to ACCEPT the data.
   
   One use of this routine is to place it in 
   a timing loop before ACCEPTing keyboard data.
   This allows a "timeout" ACCEPT - if data is 
   entered before the loop times out, an ACCEPT 
   can be done to process the data; otherwise
   some default action may take place. Normally,
   an ACCEPT will wait until data is entered or
   the process is terminated. The timing loop may
   be based on a fixed number of iterations of 
   the call, which is machine dependent, or based 
   on a period of time derived from ACCEPT ... FROM
   TIME. For example, the following procedure may
   be used:

	PERFORM P900-CHECK-KEYBOARD
	   UNTIL KEYBOARD-CHECK-DONE = "YES".
	IF KEYBOARD-STATUS = "00"
	   ACCEPT KEYBOARD-LINE
	ELSE
	   MOVE DEFAULT-DATA TO KEYBOARD-LINE.

   where P900-CHECK-KEYBOARD would call KBDAVAIL 
   and do some timing checks, which can be used 
   to set KEYBOARD-CHECK-DONE to "YES".


   CURPOS will return the current line (x) and 
   column (y) values of the screen cursor. This
   may be useful for determining the last field 
   entered during a screen ACCEPT, for example.

   In general, after an ACCEPT or DISPLAY, the 
   cursor is placed in the column immediately 
   following the last field involved in the 
   operation.

   Following is a list of special circumstances
   involving the cursor.  (x, y) is assumed to
   be the previous cursor position if a position
   is not specified. Blank-screen is a screen 
   containing only BLANK SCREEN.

Operation	Cursor placement after operation

Program startup	           (1, 1)
DISPLAY (x, y) ERASE       (x, y)
DISPLAY (x, y) data-name   (x, (y + data-name size + 1))
ACCEPT (x, y) data-name    (x, (y + data-name size + 1))
DISPLAY blank-screen       (1, 1)
DISPLAY screen-name        1 column past the end of the
                              last screen line
ACCEPT screen-name         1 column past the end of the
                              field the cursor was in
                              when the ACCEPT was
                              terminated
DISPLAY data-name          (x + 1, 1)
ACCEPT data-name           (x + 1, 1)

       F.1   Compile Time Error Messages

       F.1.2 Program Syntax Errors


      INSPECT REPLACING operands have incorrect length
   
      The operands used in the REPLACING form of the 
      INSPECT statement must be the same length. If 
      CHARACTERS is used, the replacing operand must
      have a length of 1. If the replaced operand is
      a figurative constant, the replacing operand 
      must have a length of 1. 

      
      Illegal structure: Item beyond scope of 
         OCCURS/DEPENDING.

      A variable sized data item, defined as one 
      containing the OCCURS DEPENDING ON clause, 
      had more data defined following the variable 
      length section of the record.  A variable 
      sized data item may only be followed, within
      the current 01 level data item, by data 
      description entries which are subordinate to it.

      END DECLARATIVES required.

      A DECLARATIVES header was declared with no
      matching END DECLARATIVES.

        F.2   Runtime Error Messages

      Subroutine must be CALLed.

      A program with a USING list in its PROCEDURE
      DIVISION header has been invoked directly,
      rather than being CALLed from a COBOL program.
      Since the LINKAGE SECTION variables are undefined,
      this is not allowed.

      CALL parameters mismatched.

      The number of elements in the USING list in a 
      CALLed program's PROCEDURE DIVISION header does
      not match the number of elements in the USING
      list of the CALL statement that CALLed the
      subroutine.

      Must run Install.

      Screen DISPLAYs or ACCEPTs were attempted which 
      used Microsoft extensions supported by the INSTALL
      utility, but INSTALL had not been run. See this
      manual for instructions on running INSTALL.

APPENDIX G    Loading the Indexed File Handler

G.3 Error Handling

Opening a large number of Indexed files or using
files with very large records may cause ISAM to
run out of buffer memory space. If this happens,
and a FILE-STATUS item has been defined, the
file operation that caused the memory overflow
will return status "96". If no FILE-STATUS item
was defined, the runtime error message "Need
more memory" will be displayed and the job will
be cancelled.

The /S switch may be used to increase the buffer
space available to ISAM. Note that this switch
must be entered exactly as described, with
a colon (:) after the S and no spaces in the
command line. E.g.,

              ISAM/S:20000

is a valid invocation of ISAM with the /S switch.
